An obnoxious, repulsive family of thieves, led by bad grandpa Lionel Stander inherits a bogus goldmine deed, with all the fake seals and signatures. Stander's oldest grandson sets out to sell it for big bucks, teaming up with conman/fake monk Jack Palance to swindle as much money as possible.There's more groans than laughs in this painfully unfunny "comedy", directed by the usually entertaining Enzo G. Castellari, perhaps his worst. Palance is occasionally amusing, though mostly wasted, and probably very wasted when he accepted an offer to star in this pot of stale spaghetti slapstick.The score by Guido and Fabrizio De Angelis (who have done better also), is as embarrassingly bad as the endless sight gags.
