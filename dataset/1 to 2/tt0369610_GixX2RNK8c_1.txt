I am giving this title a 1 in an attempt to bring down the score that it does not currently deserve.This movie had its cool moments, but mostly just dumb.Way too many special effects and just unrealistic scenarios. e.g. At one point a woman in high heels is outrunning a T-rex. Remember in the original Jurrasic park the T-Rex was chasing down a Jeep at top speed!No spoilers but the ending is terrible and cheesy.Chris Pratt is pretty much just an extra in his own movie.It's a shame that it got so much hype that they are already planning the sequel. I am glad I got free cinema tickets when I saw this and didn't pay any money.
