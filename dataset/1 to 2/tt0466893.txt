As was so ably and succinctly said elsewhere "Margaret is nothing more than a character study of a stereotypically hostile, obnoxious teenager." Anna Paquin's acting is brilliant inasmuch as she portrays a "stereotypically hostile, obnoxious teenager" flawlessly. Personally, I couldn't stand Lisa -- the character she portrays. A self-obsessed, shallow, hormonal teenager boring us all to death with her "issues" does not a fun film make.One and a half hours I'll never get back but as that was more than enough time to spend in the horrible Lisa's company and the fact that the film is a turgid two and a half hours long then I'm one hour up. A result of sorts! It's a horrible film with talented actors squandering said talent on utter garbage. I hope Anna's career doesn't stall as a result. She deserves so much better.
