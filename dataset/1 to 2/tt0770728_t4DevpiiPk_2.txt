I wanted this to be so great because I know Tim Ramos, who wrote, directed &amp; played the lead role. I wrote a review over at "Examiner News" after finally watching the film online. I was into the movie &amp; story until I saw a boom microphone drop down into two shots. That just ruined it for me. It broke into reality. I also thought Nick (Tim) had more of a brother relationship with his best friend Ron instead of Chi (Gil Birmingham). I just didn't believe it. I really liked the sports radio DJ idea &amp; wished there was more. Visually, the reservation home, landscapes &amp; lakes had character. I just can't get over that boom microphone. But hey, Tim gave it his best shot as a native filmmaker. All the best Tim. RP
