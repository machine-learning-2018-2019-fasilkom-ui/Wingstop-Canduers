From the very beginning I was ready for an action packed movie. What I actually got was a slow paced, C movie with a complete lack of interesting plot, acting or anything else which makes a movie worthwhile. Did the entire cast and director aimed to be nominated for rotten tomatoes nominations? They fully deserve them. They will definitely get my vote. PLEASE don't go to this particular movie. It hurts your eyes and will damage your ears. Don't say I didn't warn you. There are plenty of other films more interesting, such as.... a still from an aquarium with some boring gold fishes in it. Complete and utter waste of your time and mine.
