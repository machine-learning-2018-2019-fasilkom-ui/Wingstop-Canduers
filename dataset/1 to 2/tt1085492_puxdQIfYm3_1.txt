....its because it SUCKSSSSSSSSSSSS ....pls pls don't waste your time.This is what happens with a silver spoon USC film grad son of some big producer needs a favor to be called in......no holds bar.Would you really watch a movie where Patrick whoever was the lead, John Cosack makes a 5 min cameo, 50 cent even shorter? Can you believe a bunch of exes sitting around a table and greenlighting a movie today where a noname want to be father bad ass kills 200 people with automatics and only with his small gun. This isn't dumb.....its just an exercise in making a movie to lose money and write it off.GARBAGE
