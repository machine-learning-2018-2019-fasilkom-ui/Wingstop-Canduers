This movie was so awful i wish i didn't even have to give it a star. thank god i only waisted a dollar 25 or whatever and an hour or so of my life on this god awful movie. Don't see this!! it had noooo story line whatsoever. it never went anywhere. horrible, seriously. the distcription of it when you go to rent it from red box it seems like its gonna be another shutter island kinda scary but the whole description was miss leading and i couldn't be more disappointed. i can't believe I'm waisting my time on this thing!! that is all. and i never write reviews unless they are this bad. thanks for reading..hope you take my advice! xox
