I really tried to look at this movie with an open mind although this type of movie isn't really my cup of tea anyway so to speak. It was awful to say the least with no cohesive plot whatsoever! It glorified the worst aspects in our society and portrayed the "thug" lifestyle as somehow glamorous? It was directed with an obvious bias to regurgitate the same old stereotypes everyone already has but in a way that attempts, but fails, to put a positive spin on "Hip Hop" culture. Just not a good movie in any way, shape, or form. Do not go see! If you want to see a great movie with an African American cast that is uplifting and shows what is admirable about our great society then go see "War Room"!!
