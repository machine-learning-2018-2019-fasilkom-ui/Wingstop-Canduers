This movie tells the story of 5 corrupt musicians who live a depraved life and are happy about it!. This bad biography film is about the life of the Rap group NWA. The story basically follows the life of Eazy-E, Dr Dre, and Ice Cube.The film is so boring and have a slow pace . The women nudity and the hardcore could please horny men for a temporary period of time.After seeing the movie I was really disappointed because I did not see any drama in it and the boredom in it really kills and sucks so bad.Sadly this is a bad adult movie with corrupt men that I advise you to avoid.
