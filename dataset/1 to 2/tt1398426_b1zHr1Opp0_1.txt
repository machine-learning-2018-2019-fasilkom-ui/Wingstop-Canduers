This was appalling to watch real hip hop and rap was people like Kool Moe Dee or the young Busy Bee movie's like this make our world a harder place It felt like this was sent out out to all the teens and children it's wrong appalling. This isn't how music should be this genre is so poisoned and tainted it shouldn't of been funded it was unbearable. Would it of been so hard to have some positive people in it positive lyrics. Not that their life stories aren't bad or respected it's just the movie was all about rewarding ignorance I feel like anyone that watched this has been tainted it's not the cast, I respect some of the cast it just put the wrong message out to people especially the ones underage that will watch this. The swearing, drugs and violence were a huge impact on this and now more teens will do it monkey see monkey do. If it was old school if it was like respected hip hop artist in the 80's it would of been way better and I would of loved it.
