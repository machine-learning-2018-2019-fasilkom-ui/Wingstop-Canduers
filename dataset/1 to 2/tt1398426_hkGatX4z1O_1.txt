I am not a big fan of N.W.A and their music does not interest me. I have to admit that after seeing this movie I was overwhelmed with dismay. It is true that the media and the movie critics have been slanting the news to trap us into seeing this film.Alas what a boring film!.From the beginning to end,this documentary movie about five black rappers failed to impress me.Off course this movie deserves a fair NC17 rating,but the explicit sex and the bad language did not offend me since I am an adult.What I strongly hated about this movie is that it indirectly promotes racism and hatred against black people for in this movie are represented as ruthless and immoral rebels .Sorry to tell you that (Straight Outta Compton) is a movie you should avoid if you do not want to waste your time and lose your money.
