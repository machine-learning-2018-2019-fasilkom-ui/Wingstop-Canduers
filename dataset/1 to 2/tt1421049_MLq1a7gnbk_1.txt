OK i am a huge film fanatic and have seen many horrible movies and still forced myself to try and enjoy it and find good points. i am also a major wrestling fan have been for 12 years which is the reason i decided to watch this film. Please anyone that is reading this before watching the film DO NOT WATCH IT! it is awful in every way. acting is the worst i have ever seen from everyone involved. the film work is filmed like a old horror movie and even if you take that into consideration the film work is still completely terrible. i got 30 minutes through ( how i don't know) and i had to turn it off which is something i can never recall doing. ( as i said i always try to find good points.) Now moving onto the wrestlers. Kurt angle has disgraced himself and all wrestlers turned actors in this film. i actually felt sorry for him that he did this movie. Knash and Sid Vicous is where i turned it off after finally seeing them i realised there is just no chance this movie is getting better and they obviously did it for the money (which i hope wasn't much as they don't deserve it from this performance)this is certainly the worst film i have seen 100% and if i find one worse i might start making movies myself if one worse than this can get produced onto DVD.
