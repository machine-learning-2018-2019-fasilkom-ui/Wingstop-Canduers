OK, I like B...and even some decent C movies. Going in, if you know it is a B, or C, you can offset it normally...maybe consider low budget might be offset by cute girls, scary off-screen suspense, or maybe just a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor. Kurt Angle has nothing to bring to this movie, and for him to be in over half the scenes, it's like seeing a tax auditor show up...and read his lines from a 3x5 index card. You know it's bad going in, when in the first scene you see him, you notice the cardboard 'sheriff's star' on his brown ballcap. A budget over $3 million, and they couldn't actually get him a plastic badge? Geesh. Do you remember high school, and someone having to read from a textbook? Do you remember the poor readers that made each word an agony to hear, as you followed along in the book, wanting to help them read it to ease the pain? Yeah, this movie is like that...only much worse. Do yourself a favor, pass on this movie and watch Scorpion King II, or Ishtar, or Jaws 4 or Rocky 5 or something...they are far less painful to your mind.
