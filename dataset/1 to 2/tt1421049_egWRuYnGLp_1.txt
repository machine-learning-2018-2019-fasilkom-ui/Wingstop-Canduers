oh..come on! seriously??? worst film ever... oh my god...i just cannot believe it! everything about the movie was terrible. At one point, I actually thought that it was a horror/comedy. But turns out that it's not. you've gotta be kidding me to actually call this a movie and release it. seriously. I would not even want to get paid to watch this movie another time. horrendous.Didn't the maker of this movie even watch this once, before he actually went on to release it? oh my god...seriously, this has got to be a joke or something.
