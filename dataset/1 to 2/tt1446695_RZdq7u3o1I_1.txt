Yet I can't rate it. I can tell you what it isn't...it isn't scary, it isn't suspenseful. What it is in one word...depressing. I'm writing this review in hopes of saving you time and tears. Literal tears. This movie WILL strike a chord with you and nestle into your ever- tightening chest. It isn't that anything that happens in the movie is truly shocking, it's just woefully sad. If you're looking for a psychological thriller, or a who-dun-it, then you need to move along. I literally balled my eyes out. If you want to be moderately confused, and then cry a lot, watch this.
