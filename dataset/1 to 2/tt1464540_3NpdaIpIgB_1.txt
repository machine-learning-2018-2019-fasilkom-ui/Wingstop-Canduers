dainefan took the words right out of my mouth. If you would pay a film admission price to watch two hours of predictable, cliché, and poorly acted supernatural teen soap drama, you may enjoy this movie. I watch movies of all genres several times a week and enjoy the vast majority. I Am Number Four is one of the very few films that I've very nearly walked out on (before it was even halfway over).Honestly, I was intrigued by the premise. Sci-fi and fantasy are two of my favourite genres. But in the back of my mind, I sensed I might be disappointed with this one, so I went in with low expectations. I came out embarrassed to have willfully endured such an atrocity.In retrospect, I sincerely wish I had walked out. The only good thing that came of seeing this film is that now I can warn others to stay away from it.If you have a craving for supernatural action-drama, turn on your TV or visit a streaming TV site and choose any show in that genre at random; I have no doubt you will find something equally "good", but more likely far better than this, for a bargain.
