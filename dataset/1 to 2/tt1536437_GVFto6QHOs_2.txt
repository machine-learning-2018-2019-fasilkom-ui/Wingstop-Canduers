The plot of this film is so ridiculous, it really is camp. The twists and turns are ridiculous. Josh Henderson is damn cute/hot and kept me tuned in. Most of the acting is over the top, and gives this movie a surreal feeling. The lighting is very,'TV movie of the week,'as are the sets. Watch only at 4a.m. when you can't sleep.
