This is so bad.. The only reason I rented it was because the cover looked pretty good and all the movies I seen of Robin Hood were pretty damn good..They need to pay people to watch this..The acting and lines are atrocious I couldn't watch more then 5 minutes of the movie I even skipped ahead to see if it got any better but no..This is more like a Elementary school acting with adults..save yourself the money watch something else.This movie is so bad I made an account here to just post how really bad it was.I would be ashamed to have my name on the credits.
