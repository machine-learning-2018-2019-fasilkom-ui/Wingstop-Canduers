This movie is not even remotely good. I appreciate a good low budget or even micro budget film. This is not that! The acting is brutal, line delivery is like listening to a customer service line where the English is forced at best with extreme limited understand-ability, and there is no coherent direction for the film. It's a comedy ... no it's an action flick ... but wait it's a zombie movie. I mean it can be all three if meshed together and apparent. This is not meshed at all. It goes in one direction then another and another. Serious, scary, fun, silly, or just plain no good? Guess.. I'm not a big fan, but I did watch the whole movie &amp; the special features which made me understand the quality a bit.
