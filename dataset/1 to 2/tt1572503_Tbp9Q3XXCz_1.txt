Have you ever watched a tearjerker? One that was so traumatizing that it tugged at your heart and made you think about it well after you had watched it. Well, folks this is definitely one of those. This movie is so bad you will really cry. The action, acting special effect are all just horrible...WHY KANE HODDER? WHYYYY????? ZOOZOO.....cricket, WHAT THE HECK IS THAT???? It should have been used to prevent this movie from being made. Please keep to what you do best...Hack N Slash. You didn't have to do this.For anyone who reads this I give you fair warning it is one of the worst movies of 2012...... No, of all eternity. For your sanity don't watch it unless you want to lose all friends and family.
