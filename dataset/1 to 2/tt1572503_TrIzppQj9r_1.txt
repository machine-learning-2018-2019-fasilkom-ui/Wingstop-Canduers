I have only myself to blame...A colleague said to, "last night I watched the worst film ever made", to which I replied "are you sure? I've seen some pretty awful films in my time".He lent me the DVD... ...after 20 minutes I tried gnawing my own leg off while trying to hope that the film would improve, but it then performed the impossible accomplishment of getting even worse! DO NOT fall for this trap! The ONLY person involved with this film that deserves any endorsement is the person who designed the DVD Box (which is really rather good).
