Holy god in heaven above...As a film maker, I hate to hit hard on other independent directors, but for the sake of humanity, sometimes... just sometimes, you have to!The cover looked great, a holographic ghost-faced Robin Hood. The fact that it made it to distribution pulled me another step closer... and then I found it brand new in Poundland.For a pound yes.I have seen thousands of films in my time. I have seen some sh*t in my time. Some critics and film buffs would go on to say I have made some sh*t in my time... but knowing what went into this, and what we put into ours, well, I don't think I need to take it to heart!Oh yes, the film. From the opening scenes you begin to wonder what did you just buy, then, even by jumping chapters and giving them a chance, you soon find out as your eyes start bleeding at the embarrassingly poor performances from everyone (including FX legend and major Richard head Tom Savini who should just give up), the awful action scenes, FX - yes, even with Tom involved in the film you reckon they would have had a chance.I could go on!Robin Hood: Ghosts Of Sherwood is fitting, as anyone that buys this film is getting robbed!I can't even put it in the so-bad-its-good category...
