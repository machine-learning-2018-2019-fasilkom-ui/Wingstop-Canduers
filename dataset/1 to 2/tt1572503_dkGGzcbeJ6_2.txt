This really is a bad movie. Given how much dialogue and inane chatter the film contains honestly, the terrible dubbing (the film is German) that makes it even worse....though the dialogue (OMG, the dialogue--no the propaganda!)the dubbers babble on and on is definitely part of the problem. Plays like a bunch of medieval re-enactors who decided on a lark to put a movie together; in other words, amateurish. If anything it's a political communist manifesto--and I mean in the fundamental sense: they talk about the system; sharing and share alike (no need to set guards! We share everything here!), "everyone is equal and no one person is better than another" and on and on and on....."Snooze". And on. I rarely, and I mean almost never turn off a movie before it's finished, let alone write a review, but this one is just so....so.....so.....Ack!
