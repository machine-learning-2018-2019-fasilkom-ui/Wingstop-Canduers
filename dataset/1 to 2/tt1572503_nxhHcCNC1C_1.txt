I really don't understand, why anyone would make something like this. This movie is so bad and so badly acted, that is will make your eyes and ears bleed. The story is terrible, the acting bad, the costumes are a joke, and the special effect and fight scenes are bad ... even for a B movie.Give the local kinder garden a phone cam and some money for costumes, and i am sure they would do a better job. This movie really have to be one of the worst ever made!So, if u don't wanna waste your time or money, stay away from this crap movie...
