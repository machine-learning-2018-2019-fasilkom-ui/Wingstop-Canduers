I had some hope for this movie, as the first two minutes were not too bad action in a fast pace, but then... the titles, two minutes of stills. No panning even. That really pulled me back to my original bias, that this would be a badly done movie. Yep. Some minutes later Robin and Marian have a dialog. Both performances are truly beyond every grade of awful. The conversation dry and unable to catch my interest in any way. At this point, I see that any further watching of this poor excuse for a movie, would be a real pain. So I deleted it, and decided to write this as a warning. Even if you are a Robin Hood fan, or like to grab a low budget movie once in a while, do not watch this one. It is a f*ckload of diseased crap.
