The previous reviewers must know the actors or film crew. The acting especially by the adults is horrible. I get this is a low budget film but the acting is so bad it is almost impossible to watch. My 11 and 9 year old even made fun of the movie. This movie entertained my 2 year old for a little bit. The message isn't horrible but it was hard to keep watching. We were expecting a dolphin tale type movie. The kid acting is OK and this movie would of been better if no adults were in it. The movie was appropriate for all ages which is a welcome change these days. I think a documentary movie that just showed facts would of been better. There is one good part. The music was really good even my kids cheered when the music started playing. Unfortunately there wasn't t enough music to make it better.
