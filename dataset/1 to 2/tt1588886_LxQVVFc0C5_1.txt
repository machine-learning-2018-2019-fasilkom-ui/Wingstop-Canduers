Greystone Park aka The Asylum Tapes.. starts with the master director and his prodigal son (?) discussing about ghosts and spooky things in a dim lit dinner table along with few other guys and gals.. And,, some of them head to film the Greystone park and the mental asylum which is there.. The horror starts..Should i say horror or utter confusion.. ??What goes next is a serious rehashed scenes taken from well known found footage movies.. and its so disgusting and comedy filled direction less scenes.. you would actually destroy your beloved DVD player or bluray player or the TV in which you are watching this nth grade noobish movie..If you are a true horror fan.. just give it a go.. and fast forward all the way and finish the movie watching in 3-4 minutes. Thats it. The so called great Oliver Stone is appearing in few frames .. for reasons unknown even to the smartest Sherlock Holmes alive ... maybe MiB3 would appreciate better.. ;-)
