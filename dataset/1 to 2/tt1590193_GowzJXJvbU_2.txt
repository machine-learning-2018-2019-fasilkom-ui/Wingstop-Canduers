Why do movies seem to be getting so complicated? The good ones flow with ease and simplicity and aren't supposed to lead the viewer on a journey through a convoluted wormhole of unbelievable BS. This Hollywood farce challenged me at every turn and left me saying NO WAY again and again...I like movies where you know the bad guys and the good guys...like Shane. I like movies where the heroes are believable and not 60-year-old insurance salesmen tearing through people like the Incredible Hulk. I like movies that entertain me and not piss me off with their stupidity. This one is destined for the DVD ash heap and Liam Neeson better start collecting Social Security.
