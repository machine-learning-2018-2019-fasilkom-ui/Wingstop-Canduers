This was one of the dumbest and laziest scripts ever produced to be headlined by big actors. The story itself was disjointed and silly. Aging financially strapped 60 year old Liam lives paycheck to paycheck, house mortgaged to the hilt with his son's college tuition due and he gets fired. He pleads to keep his job stating that he was going to retire in 5 years. Not sure what planet that was going to happen in his financial situation. After making a poor choice Liam has to figure out who on the train doesn't belong and we spend an agonizing hour going through literally EVERY passenger until ding, ding, ding he finally gets to the last option and realizes DUH it was her all along. Then a lot more silly and ridiculous things happen including a lot of amateurish CGI and the movie 'conspiracy' wraps up in an even more simplistic and lazy way. The funniest part of this movie was the constant injection of how bad wall street is, how he lost all his money in 2008 (I guess he didn't leave it in the market and recover over the last 10 years like everyone else) and at one point he even curses Goldman Sachs.. Spare us your stupid rhetoric (btw Goldman Sachs is a HUGE democrat donor). The reason Die Hard was great was Bruce Willis didn't stop to scream screw you Merrill Lynch while pontificating how much of a victim he was. Seriously ridiculous. If I had paid for this I would have walked out and asked for my money back.
