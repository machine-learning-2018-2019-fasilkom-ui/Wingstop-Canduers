The scenario of What Happens Next is that a good, wealthy, middle-aged and apparently straight confirmed bachelor CEO retires and discovers his inner self, his budding gay inner self. This film would have been a camp riot if it starred Doris Day and the late Rock Hudson, but Jon Lindstorm in the lead just can't pull it off.He seemed too reserved from start to finish. I never felt his character became alive. He never blossomed, never really relished his new out gay identity, which was the main thrust of the movie. Without that, there is no substance to What Happens Next. You don't care what happens next. The cinematography appears seriously flawed. Lindstorm looked jaundiced throughout the picture, as if he had terminal hepatitis.Chris Murrah as Lindstorm's love interest was superb, his performance was right on target, tender, enjoyable, believable. Had Murrah been paired with a stronger, more healthy-looking onscreen partner, the result may have been more effective.I've read other reviews, and they extoll the awards that female lead Wendie Malick has earned, but that doesn't burnish her wholly peripheral performance here, nor does it sharpen the flat script. A movie can only stand on its own merits, and What Happens Next unfortunately fails on all accounts. Don't waste an hour-and-a-half of your life waiting for a payoff that never arrives.
