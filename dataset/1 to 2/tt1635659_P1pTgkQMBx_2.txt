I gave this movie a 2 because at times Wendy Malick was watchable. The rest was painful at best. The dialogue is horrible and trite. The acting wasn't nearly good enough to save the dialogue. The characters were false and empty at best. They were either boring and made no sense or over the top and made no sense. All in all - OUCH! The premise was interesting, but there wasn't enough motivation to move the story along. I think the writer might have been trying for one of those quirky, independent, everyone is connected whether they know it or not movies - but if so it hasn't been achieved. The only saving grace of this movie was Wendy Malick. She is funny and fun to watch. Her portrayal of Elise is great. When she shares a scene with others (such as Chris Murrah, who plays Andy) her performance and what she brings to the role elevates the performances of the others.
