The actor playing the gay guy must of been the author of this movie because he sure as heck is not an actor. I looked him up on IMDb and this is his only credit. No surprise there. This is like a commercial for being gay, and so cliché. The gay guys are so gay. The main one, Andy wears baseball caps that say San Francisco, and PFLAG, ( families for gay and lesbians, who must of helped pay the film, since he wears this cap most of the film). One word for this movie, clunky and awkward. It feels like a student video for school. The idea was to show a middle age man discovering he is gay. Labored bad sitcom writing, making points with baseball hats. Groan. Yes that bad.
