Wow this is one bad movie.
I don't even know how to describe how bad this film is.
The acting is just the pits.
The writing is non-existent.
The directing is -- what directing?
The music track for some reason overpowers the movie so when there is musi you can't hear the dialog. Maybe that's a blessing.
Here's a caveat to my review-- after the initial horrible segment I started to FF looking for female nudity.
THAT's how bad this movie is.
The handful of glowing good reviews here are clearly fake.
