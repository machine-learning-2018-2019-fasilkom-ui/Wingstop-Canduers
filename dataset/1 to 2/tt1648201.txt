How lucky we are that Calvin Klein offers almost two hours of his pretty self-indulgent people gazing into the soul less eyes of a matching mate! Oh you mean this was not about French jeans? The brothers Polish are far from any substance or verisimilitude. Because you make a black and white movie and film it in Paris, doesn't make it art. It was an orgy of photography without any sex. I rather make fun of Karl Lagerfeld or wonder if anything ever came between Brook Shield's jeans than spend a relaxing night watching this vacuous dreck. The music goes up 20 times the needed volume like Rush Limbaugh's screams about nothing. The dialog is worse than a teen trying to write poetry about an escapade. Besides waiting to hear if anything poetic or insightful was said when the actors finally did speak, they're difficult to hear. My hand was getting carpal tunnel from constantly adjusting my remote from the extremes variances in the audio. I was wishing Genevieve Bujold would enter a scene and tell Stana Katic and Mark Polish to go home already or shout Action.
