I looked at the reviews before watching this movie, mostly because I never heard of it before.
I DO like Max Martini as a actor and was hoping the movie was good.
But it ends out that I hate Max Martini as a writer/director.
I rarely fast forward on movies, they mostly deserve to be watched, if I want to write a review that is.
This time I was tempted more than one time.
I cant see any other purpose of this movie than to bore the life out of the audience...As a "documentary" the movie are less than good (we see it in the news at least weekly, nothing new), as a "adventure" or road movie its less than good (its enough bad road movies out there), as a "action" movie it needs way more action. The "drama" genre fits, but its the most boring drama I have seen in a long time.Max Martini, please don't do this again, keep your ass in acting only in the future.As for all off you making a account just to rate/review this movie as 10/10, please let me know what you are smoking to think this are a good movie..Not that I think smoking stuff will make me change my mind, but it might help me forget that I ever watched it in the first place.
It fits good in my list of movies "to never watch again"
