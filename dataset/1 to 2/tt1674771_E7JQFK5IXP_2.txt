I was a big fan of the original TV series, although it did go downhill towards the end. In essence this feels like the producers are trying to squeeze the last bit of revenue from the franchise before it dies. Without the goodwill from the TV series this film would have gone straight to video and I doubt I would even be reviewing it.They have included themes from most Entourage episodes and mashed them into a single thin story. Pointless cameos (Warren Buffet - really?), gratuitous sex and liberal use of bad language add to the impression that the producers have run out of ideas.Unimaginative, tired and contrived.
