In Germany we got some horrible actors (due to a vast amount of cheap and unbearable TV-production) and obviously the worst of them were casted for this movie. If the Italian and french actors were any good was hard to tell, because the aura of incompetence of their German colleagues was just overwhelming. Sometimes it is possible even to do a good movie with bad actors when you give them the right roles and commands, but the director of "Girl on a Bicycle" obviously was not able to do it. I tried to concentrate just on the script an imagined some decent actors to speak it, but that did not work either. It was so horrible that I had to switch it of after 20 minutes. No second chance. It caused too much pain.
