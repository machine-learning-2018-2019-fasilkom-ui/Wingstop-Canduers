Well what can i say about most movies today coming out of studios today apart from a major lack of creativity, however onto the film, which i found after watching it and thinking there's an hour and a half of my life i'll never get back. Truly awful so called spooky demons which you will probably think the crew members have just raided the local fancy dress store. The acting was terrible and the story was too stupid to follow it just lacked everything a good movie should have. The only good part of this film was when the credits rolled sorry but this is awful at best and tragic such a shame as the trailer showed such promise. You have been warned!!
