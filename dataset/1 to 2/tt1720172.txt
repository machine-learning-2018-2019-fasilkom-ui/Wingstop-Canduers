The other reviewers must be blind, friends or relatives of the writer/director of this film. I've never seen a film of any genre that had so many plot holes in it that it reminded me of a piece of Swiss cheese. Actually, there were two story lines playing out simultaneously that the writer could not tie together to save his life. I kept waiting for the film to improve but then gave up and watched in awe as it became more and more ridiculous and then ended in one huge mess. I kept thinking to myself how did this movie ever get out of pre-production without someone stepping in to doctor the script. I certainly wish I had the 86 minutes back of my life after watching this clunker, and I can only warn potential viewers to watch at their own risk.
