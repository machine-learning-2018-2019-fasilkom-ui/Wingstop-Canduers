I very rarely put reviews of films but I felt I had to for this film to save anyone else form watching it. It's CGI heavy when it didn't have to be, like when a character is shot multiple times it's done with CGI when plain old special effects would have done a better job. The CGI reminded me of an early 90's game cut scene CGI. The acting is half baked, felt like it was just a pay check job. The choreography was completely terrible and made me feel embarrassed watching it. The main characters almost constant narration was unbearable. The score was poorly chosen and at one point one track finished and a different track started immediately started with a new scene. Felt very poorly edited as a whole. If I had a one use time machine or a mind wipe to revive this abomination from my life.
