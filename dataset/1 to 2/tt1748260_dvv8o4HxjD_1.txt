Sadly, this film is proof that good books can't be always translated into good films.To me, this film is nothing like the book. There is no mood set, the cast is totally wrong---the parents look like they could be the brother/sister of Davey, not parents. All poignant dialogue and scenes from the book are removed. There is no building of scenes, and they just did not translate grief except for a few brief moments. They moved and shifted characters and didn't have enough flash back sequences to unfold the mystery of Davey's grief, like in the book.Sadly, I was thoroughly disappointed all around. The fact they changed the ending as well---nothing was done right--they showed no growth of Davey as we see in the book.There are brief moments where you can really feel the grief, but sadly, with no build up, or even getting to know Davey, it falls too short.
