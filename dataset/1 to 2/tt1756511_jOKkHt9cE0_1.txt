If you're interested in a bunch of homophic, racist, out of shape men then this is the movie for you.
I've been a fan of the wrestling business for a good 27 years of my life, I respect almost anyone who can step in the ring, but this is just a disgrace to the wrestling business. These guys could be your hillbilly neighbor, no real training, pipe dreams of actually being in the business. Guys like this make the people who take this business seriously look bad.
Hearing the "wrestler" with the big ass talking about "the black monkey girls being jealous of him and his ass" was cringe worthy with how it just rolled off his tongue.
"We've had Marines come fresh out of Boot Camp and they can't do it" that's a classic quote coming from the guy who's 350 pounds and must be 70% fat.
I'd give this 0 stars if I could.
