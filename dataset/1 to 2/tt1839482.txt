This must be the most boring drug trafficking movie ever made. True, it is supposed to be following real life, which often lacks drama, but it also follows the tired script of unfortunate single mothers making bad choices, told from the perspective of their amazing daughters, so it's not really educative either. It's unclear if the script is poorly researched and light on facts, or if these drug smugglers just lead empty lives, but the whole thing has a thin TV atmosphere. The most dramatic scene is when the little girl is attacked by ants (I won't spoil it for by revealing her fate). The film itself is made well enough, and Anna Paquin looks good lounging on a boat, but the only thing I cared about was getting to the end of this pretty homage to frivolous crime.
