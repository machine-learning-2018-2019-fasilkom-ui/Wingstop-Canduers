I have never have done a review here on IMDb or anywhere else for that matter. But, this movie was so awful, I'm inclined to help others from wasting their life watching this debacle because someone with an agenda rated it high.So here it goes, I don't know where to start. Factually it is wrong on just about every scene. The acting is bad. You can see the boom in some scenes. It was amateur night. Rip Torn has stooped to a new low.The only reason I even watched this was because the only review on here gave it an 8 out of 10. Maybe that user has a directors cut, or he is off his rocker. I believe the review was made by someone affiliated with the movie, because it was that awful and they were plugging it. I finally quit watching after about 40 minutes into the movie and I could no longer take it and waste another minute of my life watching it. I should have known something was up after reading the other review when he stated that he never "looked at his watch" or "squirmed in his seat". It was a dead giveaway.In the end, trust me, this movie is bad. I actually feel dumber having watched 40 minutes and why the heck I watched that long, I'll never know. I think I watched it for about 35 minutes too long. I should have used better judgement. 1 star for my rating and if I could have given it a 0, that is what it would have been. But its just my opinion. Gary
