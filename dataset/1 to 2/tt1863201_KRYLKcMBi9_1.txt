When i came across this movie i was skeptical, so i looked it up on here and when i saw it had 6.6/10 i thought it was going to be well worth the watch. I couldn't have been more wrong. Boring storyline which takes you until the last few minutes of the movie before its all revealed, lacked imagination and wasn't scary one bit. I think the 2 reviewers who gave it 7/10 must have been the main cast members from the film. One of the worst movies i have seen, and thats being generous! Great movie if you have insomnia, this will send you straight to sleep. The acting was OK, nothing special, but overall i would not recommend this movie.
