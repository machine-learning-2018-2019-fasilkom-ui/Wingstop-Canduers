First, I am NOT a fan of 30 Days of Night. The idea is actually ridiculous. What, did the vampires in that kill and drain every town in Europe above the arctic circle? And if they did, no one noticed? So let's move on to this piece of crapola. I'd like to say I liked what they did with a non-budget, except Night of the Living Dead (68) had less money to work with and is oh, 50,000,000 times better. Lame story, lame acting, and the post apocalypse world looked so neat. How did they get Lance Riddick to be in this? Was he slumming? Did he need a few bucks during the Fringe hiatus? Chiller is, lets be honest, just as bad a channel as the previously known as the Sci-Fi channel. This movie is just another bunch of dross that will eventually bounce between both of these loser channels. I wish IMDb.com would add ZERO stars because that's what this garbage deserves. It's an insult to zombie films, even though I'm sure there will be some people out there trumpeting how great it is. I'm not one of them. Do your brain cells a favor and pass on this. PASS! Please. You'll thank me later.
