This is the stupidest movie I have ever seen. The "deadly" snakes in this movie consist of non-venomous king snakes and corn snakes. Harmless. Corn snakes do not even live in the desert. Either the people who made this movie are retarded or their budget was to afford snakes that are not family pets. Also, when the snakes are in the scene, a rattling sound plays. These snakes are not rattle snakes. Maybe it would have been more believable if they used rattlers and if the lady didn't walk through the desert for 10 hours with nothing more than a few dizzy spells caused by the deadly little king snake. The plot made no sense. The girl had an Ipod and could research snake bites but not send an email for help?
