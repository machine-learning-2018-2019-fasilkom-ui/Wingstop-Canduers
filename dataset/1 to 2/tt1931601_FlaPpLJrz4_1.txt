It would have been kinda ok if the snakes were poisonous. But they were all harmless and don't even live in the desert.
How is it that everyone died almost instantly from being bit by the snakes but she made it.
Also why the heck show a snake on the cover that is not even in the movie ( false advertisement ) and the ending was completely stupid couldn't have even showed them being rescued and having the money .
This is one of those stupid movies you continue to watch just to see if there is a good part at all and there wasn't...
