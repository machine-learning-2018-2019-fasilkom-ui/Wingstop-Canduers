My friend and I walked out. . 1) Poor writing (on par with 4 out of 5 Hollywood movies these days).This includes poor character development, unnatural dialogue, and a boring plot with no explanation of the world or characters (similar to the first, which I almost turned off). No explanation of the previous movie. (My friend hadn't seen the first. Even I saw the first and felt the dialogue was assuming too much). 2) Length - It felt like a first draft everyone was too afraid to edit down (and switch around). A shorter film (around 90 minutes) means a more concise story, and money left over in the budget to improve everything overall. From a business perspective, keeping people in their seats longer has no benefits in making the film money. Quantity does not equal quality. 3) Instead of trying to challenge or educate young people or teens (their target audience) about the world and politics by providing an intelligent story, they are doing the opposite.Writing is the essence, which holds everything together and gives purpose. It is the mind of the film and the rest is the body. No amount of excellent sound, cinematography, good looking actors, special effects, or creative costumes can mask a poorly written or shallow story.
