I just can't imagine if there was a worse movie than " The Hunting Game catching fire" too long, too boring, and no plot n story..... Don't waste your time and money on it. it really looks that too much money has been spent on making this movie but it is too confusing movie that many people started leaving the theater in the middle of the movie....
