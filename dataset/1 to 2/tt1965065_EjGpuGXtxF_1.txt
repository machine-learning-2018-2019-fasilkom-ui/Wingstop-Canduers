It has characters that are vaguely interesting but eventually I really didn't care who anyone ended up with. They were all mostly just mean or sad and made a half hearted attempt to rally at the end that left me emotionally uninvested. The ending was terrible and if I actually had liked the characters I might have cared. I was just thinking the other day that I generally like all movies. But alas no.If you want to watch a movie where characters are lost and seem to want to stay lost and further seem happy being lost and communicating poorly and blaming everyone else for their problems then this movie is for you. The characters clearly have the emotional depth of a kiddy pool.
