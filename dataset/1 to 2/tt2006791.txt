I was looking forward to this film as I thought it might deal with the 4th Dimension in some way - i.e. the dimension beyond the 3D world we live in. I was disappointed though as instead it was 3 stories about the 3 corresponding directors' personal ideas associated with the theme of the 4th Dimension. To clarify, it's akin to me calling a film "Nuclear Fission", and then shooting a family drama in a disused nuclear power station. Yup - the connection is really that tenuous.So we get 3 distinct segments by different directors, each with its own story.First we see Val Kilmer as a sort of man-child BMX-riding motivational speaker in the loosest sense of the word.Then we get an introverted Russian inventor experimenting with a time travel device while resisting the advances of his neighbour.Finally we see 4 youths running wild through an evacuated suburb prior to a flood event.I'd say the middle segment was the least bad by some margin, but it certainly wasn't great. At least it had some relation with the 4th dimension, if you believe the 4th dimension to be time that is. And it kind of reminded me of a charming french tale about an eccentric man and unlikely love, though altogether less charming in this context, and handled in a very ham-fisted way.The Val Kilmer segment was the worst - he could easily play a motivational speaker but the material here was just dire and childish - no real story.The final segment wasn't much better I'm afraid - just random bleak meanderings and no real direction for my money.There are some decent shots and some good acting but you've got to have some kind of story to hang that on otherwise what the hell are we all doing here?Maybe I just missed something fundamental here but otherwise, this is a terrible movie to be avoided at all costs.I feel sorry for Kilmer as he's more talented than this and deserves better roles.
