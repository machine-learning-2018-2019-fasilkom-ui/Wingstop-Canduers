FIrst off, I don't believe this was shot in 2011 for a second. It looks, feels and sounds like it was a shot on video quckie from the 1980s. I mean, someone talks about a Tandy 2 for god's sake. There is nothing good about this movie. DIalogue, acting, special effects, pacing, all are subpar. You wanna know how bad this is? The Polenia brothers would say it was crap. The most disgusting thing is not the horrible gore effects, but the naked actors!Stay away unless you have a strong stomach. RIfftrax wouldn't even touch this.Dirkmaster
