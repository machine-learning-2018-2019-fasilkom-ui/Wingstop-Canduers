I'm a massive fan of comedy horrors doesn't matter how low budget but this movies plot is just frustrating from start to finish! So many small simple things don't make sense or add up and the ending to this movie would have to be the worst ending I've ever seen!! I'm not one to post reviews but this movie made me that angry at how stupid it is (not a good kind of stupid) I had to share my views and hopefully save someone else from going through this painful movie. There is not one likable character and when you do come across a better character there killed off!! Towards the end you feel there's going to be a typical plot twist which you feel you could still be satisfied with the movie but nope nothing about this movie will pull you in, wasn't even a good love story almost like it was just chucked together on the spot!!
