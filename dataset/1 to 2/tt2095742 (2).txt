Alright, well first of all I should say that I am not a fan of the "Paranormal Activity" movies, but still have seen them, as it is allegedly ghost movies. And already prior to watching "Paranormal Incident" you already know that this is an attempt to cash in on the success of "Paranormal Activity", and as such, you know that it will be bad, just like "Paranormal Activity".And it was everything I expected! Equally bad, if not worse actually that what they were trying to cash in on. Haven't we soon had enough of these low budget, hand-held and super shaky home videos? I could make something similar with my DV camera and call it "Paranormal Phenomena".The story is about a group of people spending a couple of nights in an old, closed down mental institute, that is allegedly haunted. Some are believers in the paranormal, some aren't, but of course they are in for a night of terror and they are not alone.Nothing new to this storyline, and it was a really weak storyline at that. It had a bad script, even though the actual dialogue wasn't too bad. However, the movie was brought to the screen by some very questionable acting performances, some of which seemed so disinterested in the movie that it was painful to look at.There was nothing scary about this movie at all, just as there wasn't with "Paranormal Activity" (all three of them), and it wasn't much fun to sit through. Then why did I sit through it? Well it was in the odd chance that this movie might actually outdo "Paranormal Activity" and have something that even remotely resembled entertainment.I am a fan of ghost movies, but am getting very fed up with these particular types of movies. It is nothing but shaking hand-held camera action that you could do yourself, just get a couple of friends together, and you are all set. It is an outrage!
