I feel sorry for the actors, they are not to blame for this film turning out to be putrid garbage. To be honest they all turned in a pretty decent performance. The story, while being very derivative of other films in this genre, isn't really to blame either. There were some good ideas for a few scares, a scene where recording equipment was picking up footsteps that the characters couldn't hear could have been very creepy - IF our protagonists hadn't been too busy screaming abuse at each other. BADLY directed, BADLY produced, BADLY edited, BAD screenplay. The actors deserved to be in a better film, THIS could have been a better film with a little more thought &amp; effort. If you have 80 minutes to spare, it would be better to watch dog vomit dry on the pavement than waste any time on this.
