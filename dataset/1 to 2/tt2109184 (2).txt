I gave this review a 2 out of 10, I would have given this movie more had it been under the genre of comedy, but it wasn't so it fell way down the list of acceptable. I really DID forget this was a horror movie and laughed the whole way through with one scene where I did jump, but more so because I knew what was coming and the suspense of waiting for it to happen was what threw me off - not really my idea of a scare.Another good thing I will say about this besides that it's a comedy is that it can be watched without having watched the second and third one! I can't say if it can be watched without the first one but I never watched the second and third one and it made sense to me :)
