Went into this movie expecting something between Paranormal Activity 1 and Paranormal Activity 3. What I got was far from either. Without going into to much detail, I will say this movie builds up much like the previous titles only to fall short. The few scares it does contain are few and far between, I feel as though I've lost time and money on this movie I will never get back. If you really want to watch it.. Redbox.. Or P2P. This movie is honestly not worth the energy to continue writing more. I just want to say I am a big fan of the Paranormal Activity franchise. And this one just very much so disappointed me. Very sad..
