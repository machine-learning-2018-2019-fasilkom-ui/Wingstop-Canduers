Adam Sandler is so wealthy at this point, he could about anything he wants, very well, but no.This movie should have been made FOR me. I am the target audience, I grew up in the 1980s and 1990s playing these games and I WANTED to love th hell out of this film, but this could be the worst movie of 2015. The video games attacking earth is a great idea, and execution of the game characters themselves is pretty good. The movie fails at its most basic as it is supposed to be a comedy but it's just not funny. Adam Sandler is clearly phoning it in, Kevin James is up to his usual antics, the clumsy fat guy, Josh Gad screams at the top of his lungs in every scene, and even the great Peter Dinklage is not good here, though Dinklage delivers the one laugh worthy moment in the film.I was disappointed when I discovered that Chris Columbus directed the movie, as he is usually really good.This is absolutely a 2/10 production, I'm not a hater, I wanted to love this movie so much, but the terrible execution from script to screen was too poor to even consider this as something that I could recommend in good faith. With a different lead actor/approach, this could have worked in spades, but the complete lack of effort here is the true disappointment. It's as though Adam Sandler didn't even try.
