An abandoned mining town is a cool spot to film a movie, whether it's about ghosts haunting the houses or the mines, crazy people living there, a cult, it being a body dump and so on . . . after watching the Garlock incident, I actually don't know what this film in particular was about. To be fair, about 20 minutes in I started to browse the net and only partially paid attention because it was boring as heck, but still. I guess it was about them losing it after being lost, then again, they parked right at the parking lot close to the road, are they that stupid, that they can't walk half an hour? Someone here (judging by the 100% rating he gave, a person who is affiliated with the crew) said that the 'actors' were not given a script and everything was improvised . . . well, that shows. There's literally nothing going on, then random screaming and whining.Not even good enough to have it on as background noise - avoid like the plague.
