This movie was so bad that it actually made me angry. I didn't think it was possible to make a more ridiculously stupid disaster movie than 2012. I was wrong. I will just nit-pick the opening scene real fast since IMDb reviews require 10 lines of text. So a car is hanging on the side of a mountain by a tree branch. It shifts and slides down three different times for dramatic effect... Stupid. Why would the LAFD take a reporter and her camera man on a dangerous rescue mission??? Stupid. The reporter asks one of the rescuers, "What is the biggest difference from rescuing people here in LA, rather than in the Middle East?" The guy says, "Well, we aren't getting shot at over here." She proceeds to write in her notebook "CUTE NOT BRIGHT", referring to the ex-soldier who answered her question. What did she think the biggest difference would be? He gave a very valid answer to her idiotic question. This movie is terrible and completely predictable.
