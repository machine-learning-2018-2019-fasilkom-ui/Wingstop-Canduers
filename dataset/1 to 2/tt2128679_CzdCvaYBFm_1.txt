From the beginning of the movie you will hate Charlie O'Connell idiotic character, if the director is trying to create a new "Villian", he failed miserably, the character is dumb, slow, almost like he have a mental problem. The dialogues are just...unbelievable...non sense...rude and completely weird. There is not a single character you will think "ok, movie sucks but the acting of...", forget it this will never happens. The script is crap, the acting is primary school level and the cameras...oh dear... In total there are like 10 people in all the movie, effects are far from awful, are like 700 steps under awful... The action parts are like "they are really trying to make an horror movie?!" The old school "boobs + gore + pretty girls + scary character" it is far from being accomplished, there is nothing that makes people get related to this movie. This movie is not even attractive from the Bizarre/b-movie point of view.Just...awful...
