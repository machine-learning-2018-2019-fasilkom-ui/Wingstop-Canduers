(*Most demented "fatherly advice" movie-quote*) - "Remember... There are only 3 types of people in this world. Wolves. Sheep. (and) Sheepdogs." If you ask me - I'd say that "American Sniper" was just another "American Psycho" - Only this time around all of the murderous carnage that was carried out by this particular American madman was actually being applauded and condoned due to it being committed in the name and the glory of war.What really killed me about this callously pedestrian "Clint Eastwood" production was that - Once the American war-vets/bad-ass jocks were back on home turf (after all of the murdering that they had been involved in overseas) - They still wanted to shoot at things with their beloved rifles. (stroke. stroke) And, speaking about that over-praised film-maker, Clint Eastwood - In a recent interview he sneeringly spoke of today's generation (the very generation of young men who fought in the Iraqi war) as being (*quote*) "the pussy generation"... And so, with that in mind - I ask you - What sort of hypocritical statement is this 2-faced director making when he produces a film that glorifies, admires and respects a generation of Americans whom he clearly despises?... Like, hello!? - That sure seems pretty screwy to me.Anyway - This "big-bad-sniper-turns-crybaby" movie was so shamelessly padded out with endless battle scenes and snivelling "back home" soap opera that it all really boiled down to having no valid story at all.
