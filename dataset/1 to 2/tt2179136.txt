0/100 FI'm in the minority of people who didn't like Zero Dark Thirty because the finale, while I guess realistic, didn't make me feel like the Americans were any better than the terrorists who killed thousands of innocent people. I still thought American Sniper could've been good. Turns out, it was one of the most tedious, shockingly cruel, and obliviously vacuous action movies I've ever seen. The one good thing I guess I can say about it is it doesn't portray Chris Kyle like the real Chris Kyle was, someone who loved shooting down these "people of evil". But I didn't know that going into the movie, and it has no memorable or caring characters in the battlefield, no story or background behind the main antagonist, the soldiers invade a house and are invited to dinner (that would never happen in real life), half the time I couldn't tell where the shots were coming from in the choreography, and halfway in the soldiers make one of the most sexist remarks about Kyle's upcoming baby I've ever heard in cinema.You can read my full review at http://weldonwitness.weebly.com/movies/american-sniper-2015
