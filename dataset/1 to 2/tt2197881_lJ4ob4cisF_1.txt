I enjoy trains and westerns, so not knowing anything about this movie I saw the cover and decided to give it a try. The first two minutes of acting gave me a sinking feeling this wasn't going to be pleasant. I should have turned it off then, but I gave it about 30 minutes before I did. I could no longer handle the bad acting or camera work. Any sets looked like they were made out of balsa wood in a garage. Character development didn't exist and most of the cast might as well have been cardboard cut-outs. If there is any positive for me with this movie; I did like the few shots of trains used. Beyond that, I would suggest that this movie only be used as a learning tool for other movie makers.
