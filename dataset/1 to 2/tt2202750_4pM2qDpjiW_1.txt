If you watch this movie, make sure that you haven't seen the Buddies movie series or any other talking dog movie first, as you won't be left as disappointed. I could only manage 15-20 minutes of this on first viewing. When I then saw it was produced by the team from The Asylum, I should have realised that the movie would've been poor before I bought it. The special effects is just awful. and that just spoils a movie for me. Previous Asylum Movies I may have caught on TV, may have had bad SFX and story, but its surprising star movie, would've kept my attention. But this failed in that respect too.
