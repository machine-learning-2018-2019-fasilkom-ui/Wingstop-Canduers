Forced by a rabid fan-girl to watch this and I want my time back. Rip-off of Aesop's fables done so badly with so little thought to logic that I the moral's are lost.First victim? Why didn't the director/writers have her crushed to death in the weight of her greed and things that she stole? Oh no, we're just going to rip off her clothes and whip her for a bit. Second victim? She "sinned" by trusting? Give me a break. Third victim? Died of sorrow, wasn't terribly clear on it. If you're going to take fables from ancient Greece and combine the Judaic-Christo "evil" character, at least put some effort into it.Looked like they couldn't decide on what kind of costumes to use and just said, "f-it go to the flea market and take everything that you can."
