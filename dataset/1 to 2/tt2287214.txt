right of the bat this is a rape of a classic love story with after school special violence, skimpy costumes, poorly written characters, fake looking sets, and in many cases just plain bad acting, needless to say i did not enjoy what i saw one single bitand why the hell is the Liech king(Wrath) from war-craft one of Dracula's minions?all movies has their audience, and this one is directed towards children, and hillbilly's born with 6 fingers on each hand (the only reasonable explanation for the brief nudity in Dracula's castle)there are a lot of question raised around why anyone would make certain decisions during the production of this made for TV movie.-10/10 not even worthy of ironic appreciation
