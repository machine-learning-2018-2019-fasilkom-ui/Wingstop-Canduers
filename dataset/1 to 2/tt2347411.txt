I want my two minutes back. Opinions is all I heard...negative opinions at that. I was hoping for a documentary laying out the "case" of the Koch Brothers and "exposing" them if you will...but all I got was an immediate judgment and label of the Koch Brothers being evil. Zero value in a film that starts with its own conclusion/opinion before FACTS are provided.
