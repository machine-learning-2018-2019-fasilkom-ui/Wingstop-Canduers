one of the most boring inaccurate bio pics i have ever seen save your hard earned money, very little music, the music scenes that were presented seemed amateurish, Andre's vocals were way off the mark, it would have helped if he could reasonably fake the guitar scenes, but he could not.i thought i was watching Danny Bonaduce and the Partridge family fake it on TV,it was a struggle getting to the end of the movie. Wood Harris at least had Jimi's mannerisms down pat. I think the producer of this movie went for a sensationalist view of the greatest guitar player of all time. It plays more like a soap opera than a biography. As a life long fan of the man and his music, I for one left feeling angry and disappointed at this portrayal, or rather betrayal to the memory of James Marshall Hendrix
