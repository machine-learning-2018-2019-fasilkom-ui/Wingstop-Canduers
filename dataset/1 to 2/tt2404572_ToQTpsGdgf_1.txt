Basically it's two hours of empty-claims backing up the "documentary"'s preconceptions. Almost laughable but sad for the most part, seeing the pure delusion in the eyes of these people as they constantly use words they don't understand and make ridiculous claims without evidence. There is very little in-depth science, only childish comparisons between superficial things such as using cherry-picked evidence of paintings with Africans to draw the conclusion that Scottish people are black. Oh yeah, that's right, they actually claim that Scottish people are Africans and show a photo of a stereotypical Scot with bagpipes and a kilt, because "Scots have dark hair" - apparently. What would I know though, since I'm only Scottish myself.Also, the IMDb system is not flawed - they have an algorithm which detects flood-spamming. (Meaning that if they detect lots of votes from the same/similar IP ranges, it will not register them to prevent vote-rigging.) I'd recommend watching it for a laugh. One star.
