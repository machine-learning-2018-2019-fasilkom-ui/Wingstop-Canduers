The people who created this movie to show the world the real Rich Mullins must of wanted to be cruel to him and his memory. Rich wanted to be remembered as a man of joy and compassion. The movie shows him constantly depressed and having fits of temper. I could go on and on. For the sake of 1,000 words. Please know that I know Rich had a drinking problem and problems with a mean dad. And in 1970's getting medication and counseling in the conservative Christian camp wasn't popular. But why didn't you show OTHER parts of Rich.He had a lot of friends. He was so popular, his band of Ragamuffins almost started a whole new religion!He had a great sense of humor! Pick out any live footage of Rich and he's hilarious! The movie made him ugly. Terrible wig! He was MUCH nicer looking than that. Why did the movie makers do that to the memory of Rich?I am going to remember Rich as real, with real problems, yes. But I am also going to remember that he had friends and was funny. I am going to trust that he loved his ministry of singing and that gave him a lot of joy. (Not the fame and all). Not ONCE did the movie show Rich reading the Bible or in prayer. It showed him preaching and singing the Bible, but not once in any personal devotion. Why did the movie NOT portray that? His songs had to be bread out of a personal relationship with Jesus.I wish there was another movie to apologize for this one.Can't wait to see Rich in heaven. I know he's very happy there.
