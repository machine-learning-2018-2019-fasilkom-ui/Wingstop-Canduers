This may be the single worst movie I have ever seen. Crippled by a deadly solar flare, an airplane continues to fly on autopilot after the captain is electrocuted and the co-pilot is incapacitated. Far-fetched but at least plausible. However, the writing, acting and visual look and effects are on the level of the sophomore class play. It's all so bad that it borders on the classic level of "Plan 9 From Outer Space". Clichés are elevated to an art form, the characters are stunningly one- dimensional and the story is fully disconnected from facts and reality. How this movie was ever funded is beyond me. How people get paid to create drivel like this is astounding. I feel especially bad for Dee Wallace, a good actress who gamely gave it her all in a secondary role. The best thing about this movie is that eventually it ended.
