They're just happens to be a vicious dog on the airplane in the cargo hold.
Dialogue is awful! Srcipt is junk!
ATC jargon is all wrong.
The plane autopilot is disabled and in a dive at one point and at another point is a plane coming at them and they bank right but the directional gyro shows straight and level all the time!
I can't watch this anymore
