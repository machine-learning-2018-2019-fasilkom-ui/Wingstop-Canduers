First of all, I should thank with a disclaimer that I am not sure whether i am qualified enough to write about this load of tosh as i walked out of the theater after 30 minutes of sustained torture. My review is based on those 30 minutes. If somebody would make a disconnected movie out of all the adult rated jokes that you might have ever read, that somebody might end up making 'Grand Masti'. I thought i was going in for an Indianized version of the movies like 'American Pie', 'Eurotrip' et all, as i had thoroughly enjoyed them all. Believe me, its nothing like them!! The three heroes Rithesh, Vivek and Aftab run around cracking double meaning 'jokes' and scantly clad 'heroines'. The only aim is the obvious one and the movie is basically an attempt in finding whether they are successful or not. The clichéd-troubled Indian husbands - all action deprived for one stupid reason or the other, forms the basis of the movie. Indra Kumar sticks on to the formula of suspecting husband + husband of a traditional kharelu homemaker Indian wife for a deprived husband. Performance wise, I didn't watch enough to judge how the actors did but from what I saw Aftab desperately wanted to get back on to movies. Walk in: -If you can watch already read jokes on screen. -Vulgarity is your cup of tea. -Those which makes a common man cringe are 'jokes' for you. -If you want to torture a friend so bad that you do not mind going through the same ordeal yourself. -If you are looking at painful alternatives for suicide :)
