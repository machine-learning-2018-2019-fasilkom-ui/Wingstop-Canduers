Grand Masti is the sequel of 2004 hit Masti starting the same trio of Vivek,Riteish and Aftab... As the 1st one has something good the 2nd one comes with nothing at all except some good laughing scene that too copied from some Hollywood flicks... Some of the scenes are good but on whole the movie is awful... The plot of the movie is a copy paste of American Reunion... The scene are copied from Hollywood flicks like Austin Power, Ace Ventura ,American Pie and some from Bollywood itself....Story and screenplay : The story is purely penned for a adult comedy by Milan Milap Zaveri and Tushar Hiranandani and its completely shattered all the way... Screenplay by Zaveri is messed up here and there and doesn't do any good at all..Dialogues : The Dialogue from Zaveri are quite funny and good with some R rated jokes and double meaning..Performances : Riteish Deshmukh is really funny and acts well. Vivek Oberoi overacts in the whole movie and tries a lot. Aftab is not known for acting and he is just okay. All the six actresses rather girl can't act for sure. They are just horrifying actors. Pradeep Rawat is completely a wrong cast...Direction: Directed by Indra Kumar and I m shocked to watch that a man who has made movies like Dil, Beta , Ishq , Mann etc can make such a cheap movie. His direction is bad . He has done a mediocre job with this..On the whole if you don't watch Hollywood R rated movies like American Pie etc you can go and watch just once otherwise its a complete waste of money and time.....
