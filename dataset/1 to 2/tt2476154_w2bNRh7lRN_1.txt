The word CONTEXT comes to mind after watching this video( doesn't deserve the title movie), cause there was NONE.After watching this disaster, I can certainly say that graceful original comedy is extinct and it has been replaced by unpolished humorless plagiarized adult comedy. The sad part is that I could make out scenes similar to Van Wilder 3 and other foreign movies. Ritesh Deshmukh was disappointing since he is the only patron of good comedy in Indian cinema/iifa awards. It seems that he's trying to stretch out a good character he played log ago, thereby degrading it. Its demeaning and sad. As a secular atheist, I conclude that this movie doesn't appreciate women and is hell bent on objectifying and stereotyping them as bimbos.I'd reluctantly give the whole cast and crew 1 star for making the effort to make a movie and release it.
