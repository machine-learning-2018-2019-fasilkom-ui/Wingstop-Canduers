Without a shadow of doubt, this is the worst movie of the Book of Esther that my wife and I have ever encountered, let alone the worst adaptation of any Biblical book. The screenplay was atrocious, and the plot was sketchy given the many liberties taken the scriptwriter in a futile attempt to bring something fresh and novel to the age-old Biblical narrative. The direction, cinematography and editing left much to be desired. The lead actress was much too contemporary American in speech and mannerisms - not befitting of Esther, the Jewish queen of Persia. Some of the others in the cast were not convincing either. Our advice to film-buffs is to avoid this movie altogether. In other words, give this PureFlix film the flick.
