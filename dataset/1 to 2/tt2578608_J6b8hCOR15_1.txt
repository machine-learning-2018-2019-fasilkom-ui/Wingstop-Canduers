1. You must live outside of civilization to like this movie. 2. You must be a true redneck to like this awfulness. 3. You must have seen Santa Claus in an episode of "Sons of Anarchy" "My Brother" LOL!!! 4. You must love the worst of acting and direction with your popcorn. 5. You must like garble sounds as pathetic soundtrack. 6. You must like to be on an open space with snow, and walk like an ape 7. You must write a fake review and try to pass it as legit. 8. You must snore and slap yourself to be awake all the way to the first half hour. 9. You must own an 8mm handy cam 10. You must be an idiot to like this piece of trash!How easy to get ten lines, I just need to repeat "You must" as the "actors" and "director" repeat the awful patterns of dumbness for this movie.
