My first year student film in college was better than this turd, for which there isn't enough polish in the world to even give a glimmer. An old college buddy of mine actually made a little spoof/mockumentary about asshats who get a camera and a budget and have NO idea what the hell they're doing. It's really funny if you're a filmmaker, lots of in jokes, free, and DEFINITELY better entertainment than this pile of manure:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wBKVNO22gc1-10 Ratings: =========Dialogue = 0 (lines don't even make sense sometimes, like when the two cops are talking to each other in the police station, it's like they just mined the cheesiest dialogue from the worst cop movies ever made)Plot = 0 (I've seen 2 other Krampus movies, and I STILL don't know what the hell THIS story is about)Acting = 0 (your grandmother can act better than any one of these talentless hacks)Cinematography = 0 (non-existent, doubt the "filmmaker" even knows the meaning of the word)Costumes = 0 (I think my 8 year old nephew could come up with a better costume than this on a budget of $10 at the Dollar Store)OVERALL = 0 (staring at a bucket of water with a ruler in it to measure condensation would be more fun, I'd take 12 inches of evaporation over the torture of the 1 hour and 20 minutes I just endured)
