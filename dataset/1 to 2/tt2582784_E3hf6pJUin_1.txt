The movie began fine but the behavior of the characters gets intolerable.I believe the director tried to tell a story of an inappropriate woman and make it interesting but the movie makes your stomach churn.It seems like a gimmick or a stunt to act inappropriately or sleazy to draw in audiences whoever they are but if you like to see a good movie and be entertained this is certainly not the one.This is my first review for the movie since i was dragged into seeing it.I suggest watching some other movie as there are some great ones released now, please go watch them.
