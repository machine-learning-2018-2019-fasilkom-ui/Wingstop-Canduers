Why does this film have such a high rating? I've been tricked so many times this year by high-ratings and rave reviews to films which have turned out to me absolutely atrocious that I'm losing my faith in film critics and the cinema-going public alike.I was promised this film would be a tearjerker, but the only thing that jerked was my gag reflex. I have never met a more obnoxious and irritating character as Augustus Waters and the whole script was painfully cheesy for about 80% of the film.I strongly recommend you do not see this movie.Ever.Even if you are paid to watch it.
