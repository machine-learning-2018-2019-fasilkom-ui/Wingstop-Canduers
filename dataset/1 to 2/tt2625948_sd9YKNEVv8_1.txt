This was literally the worst movie I've ever seen, and I only made it through about 15 minutes. I HIGHLY recommend not watching this movie. I have to have five lines of text for this review to post so I'll spend the rest of this time saying that this movie sucked, like it REALLY sucked, and I can't believe I lost 15 minutes of my life by watching this poor excuse of a film. Completely awful.
