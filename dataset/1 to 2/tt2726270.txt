The only horror and crime about this movie is that it was ever made. This movie is just plain awful. This movie borrows so many story lines from other good movies, such as Halloween, the strangers, the purge and when a stranger calls mixes it up and vomits it up into this poor showing. The acting is average and the dialogue is even worse. This is only trumped by plot holes and characters making highly unlikely decisions even (even for a horror movie).Thirty minutes in and I watched the remainder of the movie on double speed only occasionally returning to normal speed at what I thought might be crucial moments only to speed up again. The ending of the movie tries to shock but fails miserably even in that. This movie is constantly horrible and I would recommend not wasting your time on it.
