David Dhawan made this movie for his son and I think it is only for his son not for audience. David worked with Govinda a lot not in this movie he tried to do the same with his son. like Govinda's movies you must leave your brain at home before you are going to watch Main Tera Hero.Story is noting. Varun has done overacting which is useless. Ileana looking great. Nargis Fakhri's role was not up to mark and it was not her fault. director's main motive was to keep camera on his son and he did the same. Arunodaya Singh is not for comedy his body and acting is for serious role. in spite of her small roll Evelyn Sharma looked gorgeous. when you look this movie, it will remind you many Govinda's movies.if you are going for time pass only then I suggest you must try something else like Pizza or burger. it will save money and time with much more enjoyment.
