I'm a non diver yet, I know about the use of rebreathers in cave diving. I know there is triple redundancy in safety as cave diving is extremely dangerous. These are the "best" cave divers????? The acting at times was okay. One can only do so much with horrific writing. If you're willing to drop your intelligence level to that of an intoxicated fruit fly, the film is ok.
