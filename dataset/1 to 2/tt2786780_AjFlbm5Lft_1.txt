Badly written, badly paced and badly acted.It's like they had 30 minutes worth of material and tried to spread it out into an hour and a half. Much of the dialog seemed ad-libbed or written by someone who doesn't actually interact with other people.The plot was forced and the "twist" was so obvious as to not be a twist at all.The only slightly redeeming part of the movie was Bill Mosely and even that seemed forced.The ending was so hokey and again seemed made just to lengthen the film.The final ending was laughable. Bad.
