While the twist ending is one decent twist, the hour and fifteen minutes that comes before it drags this film down, down, down. Bad acting, bad directing, poor effects and two bad guys who are obviously rip offs of the two bad guys who have a REALLY bad day in A History of Violence (except their acting stinks), drag this down. At lengths boring with a bit of nudity to spice it up, this barely helps the watcher to enjoy this. So what might have been a decent movie just spirals down into a below average waste of time.
