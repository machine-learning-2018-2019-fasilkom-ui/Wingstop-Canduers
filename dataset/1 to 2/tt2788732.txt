I'm not sure how you can make a story about a dragon boring, but they did with this movie. From the soundtrack to the cinematography, to the acting and storyline, I've honestly seen better movies on Lifetime. My kids fell asleep about halfway through it and I suffered through the predictable storyline and cringe worthy "feel good" moments. A Disney movie about a dragon should inspire the imagination, excite us, surprise us, and touch our hearts. This movie fell short in all areas. The last ten minutes of the movie are worth seeing but the lead up to those moments takes far too long. A concentration on better humor to break the nonstop sentimental expression would have gone a long way with this movie. I love fantasy and adventure movies and hopes to share a great evening with the kids. Unfortunately we fell asleep at an overpriced B rated movie.
