Had to FWD the first 15 minutes as it was all loud music and just plain predictable partying. FWD it to 30 minutes, and it got even MORE cheesy. Absolutely ridiculous film. Look, Americans - if you're going to make a movie ABOUT chupacabra - (which, of course, Google marks as a SPELLING MISTAKE - SMH), make it ABOUT the darn creature. This movie should have had a $10,000 budget - just to fly the actors there. Shaky cameras off the bat when they were getting attacked, and I can't even finish it. But, let me guess? There's an "American hero" at the end who takes the chupacabra out???!!! lol. Just like in every movie, Americans allllways come to "save the day" in the end!!! So out of touch with reality.
