Takes half the movie until anything horror-ish even start to happen and then it takes an additional 15 minutes until we actually get a look of the creatures that are suppose to be the main attraction of the movie.And although they look reasonably creepy, it just isn't enough to save the movie and for the more-part they aren't really anywhere to be seen, occasionally because they are a bit away but mostly because of shaky camera work and the fact that they seem to do most their work at night-time.The characters are also dull one-tracked party hardy boys and girls with little likability factor to them, which doesn't help.So yeah really not recommended, unless you are one of the few people who liked 'ANIMAL (2014)' cause that's similar to this. And that was also terrible.
