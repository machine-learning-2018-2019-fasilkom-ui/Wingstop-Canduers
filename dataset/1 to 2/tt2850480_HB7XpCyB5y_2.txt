I don't quite understand trying to relay in depth things thru movies by letting in more space meaning the camera zooming by houses or focusing on certain things, or needing to see one brother make food and bring it out to serve to the other brother.
This movie seemed like all filler. I believe it was nearly 5 minutes until someone actually spoke a sentence. In fairness, the movie did not pass my 15 minute test; that is, doing something to make it appealing within that time frame to keep watching. It switched scenes so rapidly that there was simply nothing to make of it. We did not even get to see the girl who apparently does something interesting and or life changing for someone. I think those persons that rated this movie highly believe they can "relate" better, or they're simply exceptionally gullible. Many good actors gone to waste here and a good argument for refunds which is a real problem. If I want to leave at say, the 10 or 15 minute mark, I should receive a refund.
