I loved this movie it is beautifully written . The acting is great.The background and town had a realistic small town appeal..The sound track by Matthew Ryan was fantastic and really set the tone and ambiance of film...A lot of today's films are over the top in set designs and non-original plots with no real character development. Not this film.Well worth the money I spent to purchase.
