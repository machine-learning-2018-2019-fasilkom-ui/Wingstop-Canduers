Camille Delmarre needs to get fired and get his job back at McDonalds! Who ever allowed Ed Skrein to play the lead in this is off his head, but I suspect it was his mother. It looks like he was hit in the teeth from the inside and then some... His acting (If you can call it that) is flat and he only has the same look on his face (like he has seen ... for the first time!). The fake hoarseness he carries in his voice is oh-just-so-laughable!Come on Hollywood, if you want to do a reboot of a franchise like this, please do not do it with 3rd rate actors!!!OK, now the action scenes, THE EDITOR, Julien Rey, NEEDS TO GET HIS HEAD OUT HIS ...! There is no continuation in the scenes and then he slows the video down JUST TO SHOW YOU HOW DYSFUNCTIONAL HE CAN MAKE IT!!!If you have some time to spare, rather get your eyes poked with forks until you have no further need to see this atrocity.As an afterthought, I find the plot (I will not go into the holes in this one) totally unbelieving. Prostitution and revenge? Never heard of it!Laughable, disappointing and just outright stupid!
