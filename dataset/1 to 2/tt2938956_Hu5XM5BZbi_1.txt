Redeeming features, nice Cars, nice GirlsThe acting was woeful, if this was supposed to be a showcase for new talent? It failed miserably Ed Skrein was simply not believable as Frank Martin, he may well have talent but if failed to find a way to escape the terrible script.The plot (what there was of it) was so predictable that I could have written the next scene before it showed up on the screen.The truth is, this movie could have been edited out of the out takes and what was on the cutting room floor from the previous Transporter Movies and it would probably have been an improvement.The Plot consisted of a few Pretty Girls exploited by Mafia type Russian bad guy, Frank takes a job and gets wrapped into a revenge plot by some of the Girls on the old Boss.Stick it in a bag shake it and print it.If you are thinking of going to the cinema to watch this, do not waste the money.It gets 1 star because someone somewhere made a living on it.
