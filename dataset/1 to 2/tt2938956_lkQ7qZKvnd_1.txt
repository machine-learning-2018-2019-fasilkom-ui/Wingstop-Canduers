Yep it is terrible. In future if you want to reboot a movie franchise, please do so without enticing me to the cinema. The stunts are awful, the fight scenes are trying to recreate Stathamness and everything appears to have been done on a miniscule budget without any thought for consequence, what the audience thinks or sees, or without any due regard for linear time.......Do not bother with it. Ed Skrein or whatever his name is, is just not Statham, I don't like Statham, but he is a far better actor than Skrein.I am now forced to write additional lines because I am not allowed to write a review less than ten lines, about a film which does not deserve ten lines of my time or space on the internet. How it managed 53% on Rotten tomatoes is beyond me
