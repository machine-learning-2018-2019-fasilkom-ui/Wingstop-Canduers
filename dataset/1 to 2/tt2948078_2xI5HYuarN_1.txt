Bad acting. Bad writing. Bad directing. Bad. The biggest thing that struck me was how it appeared that the actors, director, writer/s seemed to never have interacted with other humans before. It's like aliens were trying to sneak an alien movie into the public and they thought "This is how humans act, right?".I tuned out after the inexplicable lesbian ghost dream scene.You could enjoy this movie by turning it into a drinking game. Within the first half hour the neighbor lady says dear about 30 times. That's what old Earth human people say, right? Take a shot every time she says this and you'll have a great time."You're the bravest person I know!"
