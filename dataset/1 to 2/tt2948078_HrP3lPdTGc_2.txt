I went to Mask Fest and saw the World Premiere and I didn't understand the rave reviews then and don't understand the overly spectacular reviews on here now. I don't know if people were afraid of hurting the director's feelings or what, but it's not good, plain and simple. Not scary and down right laughable. I think there are some good ideas but it just didn't come together. I'm all for independent films but it needs to be better than this. A real disappointment especially given the fact that Lance put his name and his face on this project. Perhaps if he'd had a bigger part and it wasn't so obvious the director was trying to push his wife to the fore front it might have worked better. I listened to the comments at the premier and quite frankly I think people were just being nice so they could hob knob with Lance. The movie is just not good....sorry! Out of respect for the fact that I realize someone put their heart and soul in this project, I stayed and sat through the entire thing, hoping it would get better and it didn't. I generally don't write reviews but because of all the pre release hype that I found hard to believe, I kept waiting for someone, anyone to be honest... No one said what I and my husband were both feeling at the time, it was just not a good movie. I do give props to Betsy Baker and Lance...they were the ONLY reason we stayed til the end.
