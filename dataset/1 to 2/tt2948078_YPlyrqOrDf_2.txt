I like indie films and I'm prepared to give them slack that I wouldn't give to mainstream movies. I hated this movie. The acting was, throughout, bad. Sometimes painfully bad. Again, I can put up with that. Professional actors cost money that independent movie makers don't have and indie films give new talent a chance to make their marks. Plot and script writing on the other hand costs nothing and, in both, this movie literally falls apart. Horror movies, even the best of them, require a suspension of disbelief but, when the characters in horror movies start acting in ways that stretch credibility, you have a major problem. Example (one of many): There's a strange man in my new house. Response: Find a knife (check), find a light (check), take some pills, find a comfortable sofa, lie down, sleep till morning (nope). By the end I had completely lost interest in both the characters and the story line. The IMDb rating has been boosted by lots of positive reviews (no doubt from friends and family) and I'm confident it's only going to head in one direction. Don't waste your time watching it and, if you do, leave a suitable review. Don't be surprised however if your review is instantly attacked with lots of "This review was not useful to me" hits.
