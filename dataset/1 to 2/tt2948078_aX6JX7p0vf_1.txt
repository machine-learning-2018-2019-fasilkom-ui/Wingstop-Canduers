Sad to see that a flick containing Lance Henriksen and Betsy Baker is total crap. i admit it, I was fooled by seeing their names taking me back to Aliens (1986) with Lance and The Evil Dead (1981) with Betsy.This flick clocking in over 90 minutes is one big yawn. It's all about talking and nothing happening. It's only the last 10 minutes that the horror comes in and even that is ridiculous. Most of the horror is not shown or done off-camera. And don't watch it for your thespians, they are maybe 5 minutes in this crappy flick.The poster looked promising, sadly the flick wasn't. And people bragging give independent flicks a change. I do, i'm in the scene over 30 years so I have seen it all by now. Sorry, this doesn't offer one thing to notice. Gore 0/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 0/5 Story 0/5 Comedy 0/5
