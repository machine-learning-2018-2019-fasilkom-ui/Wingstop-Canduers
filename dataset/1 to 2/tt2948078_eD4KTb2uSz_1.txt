It's funny to see all these fake reviews and how the rating of the movie has been plummeting over the last few days.I'm not sure what to add, most points are covered by the previous reviews (the real ones, that is). The acting is stiff and amateurish, even Lance Henriksen somehow looked like he had never been in a movie before.The story is extremely stupid. Half the scenes don't serve a point, and could have been removed from the movie without making it worse. Actually, it might have made it better. But why stop there? If just all the scenes had been removed, maybe it would have been slightly watchable.Don't waste your time, not even if you're looking for a bad movie to laugh at. Go find something else to watch.
