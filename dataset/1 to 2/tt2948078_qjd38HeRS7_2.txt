Literally laugh out loud. The lead actress (Meredith Majors) is catastrophically unable to portray a convincing human, never mind a recently bereaved widow. She has less talent than a soft-porn actress, and I can tell you this for certain because there's actually a hilariously bad, and painfully inappropriate soft-porn scene inexplicably rammed into the middle of the film! You get an idea of this woman's utter lack of talent when, early on, she fails to simply walk down a road without looking like an awkward marionette. I kid you not, it's like a home movie made by doting parents who film their baby daughter self-consciously pretending to "act natural", and then force you to watch. The only redeeming features are an unaccountable cameo by Lance Henriksen and the over-enthusiastic neighbour they've invited over to help out. She can't act either, but boy she gives it a damn good try. Get out while you can.
