Why sit through this whole thing when we as an audience don't give a crap about any of the characters? They are all equally worthless...The villain is a wonderful actor. The lighting and mood are fine, but when we go to the movies what we really want is emotion. To feel, to care. And I couldn't have cared less about the stupid brother or anyone else in The Living. I guess it is a reflection of our culture that movies like this get financed, and made. How does this happen? There is zero subplot, zero nuance, and zero depth of character. It's like a silly ghost story that my 5 year old would tell, only she'd finish it quickly enough not to make me feel like my time had been stolen. Save yourself for actual movies. Maybe other ones that Chris Mulkey is in...since he's really worth watching. Just not in this.Amateur hour and a half.
