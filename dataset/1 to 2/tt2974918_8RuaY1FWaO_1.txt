I loved this movie. Let me tell you personally, it is a thousand times better than Star Wars: TFA. Of course, TFA is a great movie; however it does not live up to the standards set by this masterpiece of a movie.Brilliant story, brilliant performance, brilliant music.If I could score this an 11/10, I would very happily do so.Take a chance and see this movie, don't listen to the other reviews.No spoilers from me because this is a story you wont want to have spoil-ed, trust me on this.Great movie.10/10
