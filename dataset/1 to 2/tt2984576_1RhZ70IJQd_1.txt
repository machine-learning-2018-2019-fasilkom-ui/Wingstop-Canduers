I don't know what happened, i understand there were probably budgetary restrains and such, but damn, just damn. Everything came off badly, the acting, the lighting, the special effects, the plot and on.. worse of all, could perhaps be that ending, wtf was that?I really hope this wasn't what Gunnar Hansen had in mind, when he came up with the idea originally? And why were some of those actors even in the cast, just so they would have more names to put in the credits? Because they did absolutely nothing at all in the movie.Clearly B. Harrison Smith was overreaching, and had no right to try to make the Expendables of Horror, especially as only his third full feature movie. Maybe wait until you can actually direct, before trying something like this?
