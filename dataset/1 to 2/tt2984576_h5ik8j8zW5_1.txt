I was very excited to see this movies once I heard about it years ago. I know it went thru developmental hell but I had hope since I'm a huge horror fan and it has an allstar cast but unfortunately its One of the worst horror movies ever made they should've went with the original idea that Bruce Campbell created. Looks like it was made in a warehouse and filmed with a android phone camera. The gore is so cheesy its laughable. Dont waste your money you will regret it I wish somebody warned me about so you're welcome.
