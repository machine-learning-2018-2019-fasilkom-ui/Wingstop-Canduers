The people giving this a 10/10 clearly are by people who have not seen this before, I saw this at a convention and it was one of the worst films I've ever seen. That Cody Longo guy cannot act at all who's the one of the main characters.The director clearly does not know what he's doing. The lighting is garbage and you can barely see anything, the director does not know how to build any sort of tension. I wouldn't even suggest you renting this on Redbox. For the love of God please no one work with the director again it was embarrassing to watch. (I honestly was embarrassed that I was in a room watching a garbage film like this wasting my time)
