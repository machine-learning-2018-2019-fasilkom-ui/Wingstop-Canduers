This movie was beyond disappointing. For all the hype, it was edited poorly, filmed poorly, directed poorly, and acted poorly. If you would like to see an amazing idea (someone referred to this as The Expendables of horror) executed in a way that should make these horror stars ashamed to have their names attached to it, then this movie is for you. Otherwise? Picture in your mind what this movie could have been. Even if you picture a dumpster fire, you'll be less disappointed than actually watching it.
