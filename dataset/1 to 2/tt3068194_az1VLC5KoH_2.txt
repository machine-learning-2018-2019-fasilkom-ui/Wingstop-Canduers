The most boring Jane Austin adaptation I have ever seen. This movie was not about love and friendship but about a despicable woman who sleeps around and lies and sets a poor example for her daughter. What a joke to say this was a high rated film. We almost walked out. The only part of the movie that was "lively" was the dancing. The humor in the movie was rather idiotic as was the person portraying the idiot, though splendidly. I don't want to suffer through any more movies like this in the future. There are too many choices out there for me and this was a bad one. I have seen a lot of Jane Austin film's and this was the very worst I have ever seen.
