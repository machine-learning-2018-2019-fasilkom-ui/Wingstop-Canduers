I went to see this movie with several friends of mine whom have a shared love for all that is Jane Austen or related...however we we are all too polite and didn't say anything even though we were dying to get up and leave early...this movie was AWFUL - not worth an hour and 32 minutes of my time nor my money. The movie moved so slowly with very little plot. It had the potential to be comedic and add to the collection of Jane Austen tributes that preceded it, however it failed on both accounts. The limited somewhat funny moments were all included in the official trailer and having seen that before watching the full movie there was nothing left to freshly entertain. And I cannot forget to mention that the acting was sub-par which was surprising with such a cast...Bottom line - Invest your time and money elsewhere.
