This is kind of a movie that you would't remember any thing about it right after watched it whatsoever. Nothing impressive, no casting, no directing, no cinematography, absolute nothing, emptiness, void! I rarely watch Netflix sponsored movies or shows and after this terrible experience, I decided that even those rare incidences would definitely drop to zero. This is for Joe Swanberg, please stop making movies, you may have some other talents in some other line of businesses. Go explore the world, start from scratch, try something else, I'm sure you will be way much successful in anything else but directing a movie, I'm sure you will, anything, just try it! Thank you.
