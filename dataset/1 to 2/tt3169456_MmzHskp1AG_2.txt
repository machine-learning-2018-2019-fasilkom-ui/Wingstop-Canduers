The poor wardrobes really got in the way of enjoying this film. Whomever picked the outfits I don't believe was alive in 1980s or didn't do more than 5 minutes of research on the fashions of the decade. Most of the clothes are modern and some are polyester 70s clothes but it's a whole mishmash of styles of clothes that don't work to make a cohesive look. The film sets don't look or feel like NY in the 80s either. Take it from someone who lived through the entire decade, that's not what the 80s looked like. Not recommended.
