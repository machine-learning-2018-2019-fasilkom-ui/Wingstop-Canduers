At least 12 times during the movie, I had to ask myself of the writer knew anything about baseball. I think he researched by watching girls slow pitch softball is evident by how he thought grown men sang and chanted throughout the game. Besides that, the entire premise is crazy. Getting drafted is great, but there is not much of a difference between getting drafted in the later rounds, (as they were discussing early in the movie), and being a non roster invitee. The way they talked about Independent Leagues was incorrect. MLB does not draft players from there. The dialogue throughout the movie does not even n the slightest way come close to how men of that age would discuss baseball. At least those with any knowledge of the sport at all. I was born and raised on the sport. Played from the age of 5 through college. My father was employed by MLB. We both cried a little after watching the movie. Not due to any emotions drawn out by the writing. Rather due to how sad we were for the sport.
