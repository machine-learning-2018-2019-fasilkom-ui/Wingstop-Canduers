Okay, the come-on notes says this is an "intramural" game, but it's supposed to be a playoff game in some unidentified summer league. The players on both sides act like freshmen in high school or worse, but they all appear to be at least 24. Who ever heard guys beyond little league doing chants and cat-calls during a game. I guess the guys are older so they can say the F' word a lot, and go on about how hard life is beyond puberty. I kept watching it to see if there was a message someplace or some surprise ending like having a girlfriend pitch the last out. No, the message was "keep on trying." And the closing shots appear to be from the author/producer's little league or high school game. Oh well, keep on trying as there are a lot better sports movies out there.
