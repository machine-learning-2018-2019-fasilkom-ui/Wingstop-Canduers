This film is very insulting to black people. The only films that are more insulting is "Gone with the Wind" and "Birth of a Nation" The movie is about Noah, a widower, moves his family to a struggling inner city mission. As he and his daughters make their new home livable, they reach out to the neighborhood to bring a glimmer of hope in time for Christmas.Now every black man in this movie is a gang member or homeless. The Korean store own is rude and the white people are saints that will become hoods if they "Hang out with black folks" Racist film! Made by someone who has no clue how insensitive this crappy movie is!
