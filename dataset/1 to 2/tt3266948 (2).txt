I save one star reviews for movies that destroy the source material, like Episode 1 or Starship Troopers, so this is getting the lowest I can give.This was colossally ham handed. Every part of it was sub-par, even the performances from otherwise decent actors, but the writing was probably the worst part of it.Choppy, predictable, awkward, and fake. "I'ms sorry I was such a creep"Okay, I understand not wanting to swear, and that this was targeted at a religious audience, but look at Napolean Dynamite; no swearing, and yet there was conflict. Or any well-written TV Drama. Or even any adequate TV Drama. I have to give this review low marks, because I am just incapable of describing how bad this movie really was. I am begging you not to watch it. And I sat through Wesley Snipes' undead cowboy movie and came up with a reason it wasn't horrible. Consider that the scale of this movie's badness.
