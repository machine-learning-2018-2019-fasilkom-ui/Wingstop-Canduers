I spent 5 minutes of my life resetting my IMDb password to tell you that this is the most bizarre and stupidest movie I've ever seen. There is no defined tone. The protagonist is flat, flat, flat. This movie is whiter than the movie White Girls. What was going on in that house party / dance scene? just what. There is a scene transition every 30 seconds with the strangest music. The kid plays a robot playing a kid. I am so sorry for the people involved in this film. Someone did them very, very wrong. Of all the Sean Bean movies that he dies, his character survives this, but we'll see if his career does. I'm still just very confused about how this got made. Do people read scripts anymore?
