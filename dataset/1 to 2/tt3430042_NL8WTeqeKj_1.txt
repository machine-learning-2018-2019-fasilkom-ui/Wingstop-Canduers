Only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack. It was so slow it felt like it was going backwards.The storyline really drags and it is frustrating to watch the dialogue try to be Oscar-worthy.I really do like the music.If only it wasn't so predictable.And so so very slow.And overly dramatic.And slow and boring.And too artistic.And boring. And whiney.Loved when it ended, because it actually ended and didn't go on for eternity which is what it felt like.
