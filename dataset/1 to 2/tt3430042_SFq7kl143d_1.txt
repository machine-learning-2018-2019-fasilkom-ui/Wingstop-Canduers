I tried to watch this whole movie... I really did.It was so boring I was beginning to wonder if it was the beginning of a series and they just wanted to lead you along for the entire first episode. But thank God it's not a series, because no one would watch it. Did I already say it was boring? And had no story or plot?Boring.
