first off i implore you,if you value your time please find another movie to watch or failing that slap some paint on your wall &amp; watch that dry it'll be more entertaining believe me!.i initially thought The Phoenix Project was going to be another foray into the 'Crazy Re-Animated Guy' genre but after 20 minutes i was sadly mistaken,but if your thing is doing lame experiments on mice then this film is definitely for you,the 4 main protagonists Corey Rieger-Perry Frank,Andrew Simpson-Devin Fischer,David Pesta-Ampersand (i know i've never heard of that name either) Garner &amp; Orson Ossman-Carter Watts actually do quite a good job given that the script by Tyler Graham Pavey who is also the director is non existent suffice to say this movie is by far &amp; away the most mind numbingly dull movie i've seen in many a year &amp; to make the movie even worse it feels as though throughout its building to some kind of climax but it never happens &amp; it just fades to a whimper,so do yourself a favour &amp; watch Re- Animator the movie this movie wishes it was!
