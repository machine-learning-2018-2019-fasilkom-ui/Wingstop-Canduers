This is the second time I assumed because Amazon was streaming a movie you could trust the rating and that it was worthy of attention. But I'm learning the hard way to check the total number of ratings, and when it is low, like between 20 to 50, check out the internal spread. Apparently they do not go to that trouble. As in this example, you'll often find that half the ratings are spread out between 1 and 7 or 8, and then oddly, the other 40 to 50% are all 10's. I'm disappointed in Amazon streaming. I'm learning to stay with stay with Netflix
