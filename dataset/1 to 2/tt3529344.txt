Basically everything what might be is wrong with this picture. Any in-depth analysis would be an undeserved flatter. 1. The premise is hard to define if there is any. 2. The plot stumbles, stutters and staggers with no rhyme nor reason. 3. The acting is horrendously incompetent. 4. Music there is none - just noises. 5. The resolution does not resolve anything and tends to the incomprehensible.One may get to like however, the scene where a gangrenous leg is impromptu amputated by means of an electric non-surgical knife. But this belongs rather to WRONG TURN series than to sci-fi genre.
