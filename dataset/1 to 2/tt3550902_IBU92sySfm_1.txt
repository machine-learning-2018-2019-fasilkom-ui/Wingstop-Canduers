hard to follow,, overly complicated and more interested in looking good then telling the story. terrible set design, trying to be too cool and directed by someone who has no idea of cool. how it got funded and made and how the actors didn't leave the set before it was finished is a mystery to me. Vinnie Jones basically plays a car, i think he was welded to it. same scenes over and over again, truly horrible set design and ambiance. do not watch unless you enjoy having your time wasted. i have no idea if this was a true story or not, i can't imagine that someone like the protagonist existed and then acted in the ways portrayed in the movie. It was childlike and frankly a waste of my precious time.
