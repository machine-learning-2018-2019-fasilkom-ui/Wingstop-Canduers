I love movies, even bad ones but this was SO BAD. Tom Sizemore was in it, it can't be that bad I thought. He wouldn't have made a bad movie, he was in it for like 3 minutes. I feel stupider for having sat through the whole thing. I never write reviews but I had to warn everyone else. Don't bother... It is almost like some guy in high school watched the Usual Suspects, Pulp Fiction and a few other modern gangster movies and thought, gee, I can do this. Nothing to it... Just mash up all the cliché plot themes, scatter the time-line and have a big secret at the end and it will be so good. Maybe he thought it would launch his career and he would be so famous. Instead he has to live with the shame of knowing his friends, family and future girlfriends knowing that he was the one that wrote this god-awful story. Back to washing dishes...they say its better to try and fail than not at all. This movie is a great argument against that point.
