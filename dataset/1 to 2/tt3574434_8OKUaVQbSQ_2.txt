I loved the color, but the cinematography was the worse I've ever seen. In the first scenes you didn't follow the basic 180 rule. Yes that rule can be broken but mostly you get the audience disoriented. And thats how i felt with the cinematography, i was disoriented. The director didn't lead me see things that he wants me to see. The story is very cliché, you have a basic love triangle, a conflict that drives the 2 lovers together, and they win. Its very predictable, and who wins a perfect score at a dance competition anyway? they should have built suspense and made it that they barely won since the boy had a broken ankle. And replacing a fight with a dance off? seriously? its a hard scene to pull off but its unnecessary. This is my small rant about the film. I was entertained for the time being, but its one of those movies that i would see it once and not buy the DVD. And if i where to see it again, it would have to be under my own will because i would never see this film again. Go watch it for your curiosities sake, but don't buy it if its out on DVD. The singing and choreography is good, its what kept this movie alive, but everything else was very poor quality. to put my feelings into one sentence, This movie is a peruvian version of Highschool Musical. I don't plan on watching more peruvian cinema, this film has ruined it for me.
