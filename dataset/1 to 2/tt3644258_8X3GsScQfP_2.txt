A watchable vanity project for the writer, director, lead actor but whether it leads to anything more substantial is highly debatable, since the characters were mostly cliches, the situations were full of 'just happens to' moments, like a commercial actor on tv just happens to look exactly like a spoiled trust fund kid who just happens to be in an unfortunate accident, and the actor just happens to be paired with a gangster type gumba who just happens to want to be an actor so they can have a bond that becomes a plot point... on and on. His skill at playing two diametrically opposed characters that he himself created should have been more pronounced, but he cant get beyond the one dimensional limitations he wrote for them. An EXTREMELY nice, thoughtful, helpful, caring guy who seriously, not sarcastically, uses a word like 'lovely' when speaking to a women vs an EXTREMELY obnoxious, narcissistic spoiled brat who belittles everyone around him and tows bikini babes around like they are his pets.
That being said, he is watchable and likable as the nice guy and is assured some nice lifetime movie channel (is that still on?) cheesy romantic comedies in the near future.
