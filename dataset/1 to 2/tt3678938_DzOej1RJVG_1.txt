I am usually pretty lenient with films and rarely find films to be THIS bad. But Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania takes some of the most overused concepts in Bollywood films and puts it in one film. While the movie may be able to make money, it is definitely not the DDLJ of this decade - and it's far from it. The story line is absolute garbage, and the actors are not able to make up for it. Yes, both Alia and Varun look great in the film, but I personally do not care for their acting...other Despite being only slightly over two hours long, the movie felt like a drag to watch. Even the music is not up to par. The bottom line is that this movie does not live up to its hype and does no justice to Dharma Productions. Please save yourself the time, and if you are looking to watch a movie in the theater, go watch "Ek Villain" instead.
