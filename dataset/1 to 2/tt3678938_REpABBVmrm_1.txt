I wish there was rating in negative. I imagine how this movie was written. The most pathetic script, even worse direction blended with awful over acting. the scenes get so stupid you almost want to hit the characters. Goodness gracious!!! Censor board should visit these kind of movies and ban them for public consumption. These are injurious to a normal brain!! Trying to copy DDLJ and they fail miserably. This is the greatest tribute to foolishness!! Don't waste your money guys. Spend it on food, give it to beggars, do something else...I wish!! sincerely wish the director and the writer get this head out of their bums to not produce this kind of disaster again!!
