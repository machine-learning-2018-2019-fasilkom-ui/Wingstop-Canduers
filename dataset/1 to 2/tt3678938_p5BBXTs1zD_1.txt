I just created an account now in IMDb just to write a review about this crap that I watched few hours ago. I cannot believe people are rating up to 3 stars out of 5 and 6.1 rating!!! I just wish there was zero or negative in the vote!If you are a big DDLJ-SRK fan please stay away! I think these people have lost their mind and they think people who watch movies are stupid and mean enough to like an awful story like this. Have this director ever watched DDLJ??? I personally feel that this is perfectly crafted to mock and insult the lovely performance of SRK and Kajol in DDLJ!!! Boy I wish they would never watch this pathetic movie. I have no idea why Karan Johar would agree upon something like this. The way modern Indian culture depicted in this movie is so condemnable. Please don't watch this movie guys or you will want to slap the director and the actors for choosing this script. 'Normal Human beings' will definitely hate this movie. May be they should try showing this movie to Zombies so that they could eat these peoples brains and just kill them right away!
