Some movies are made with passion while some movies are made to make money out of it. Humpty falls in the second category. Since, Alia and Varun are the current youth icons, the young generation is crazy for them and they do watch their films in theaters just because they both are good looking, Karan Johor thought that why not rope in these two actors and make a very mainstream but glamorous movie and make money?! Both Alia and Varun are overrated and so is their movie. And the irony is that, while promoting this movie, they said that Humpty is gonna be the new DDLJ and KKHH which I don't agree. DDLJ and KKHH were iconic movies. Humpty is just another SOTY. I am sure, this movie will make money. People will love this film BUT, it will only be the dumb ones to love this film. Intelligent people won't have this film in their list of favorite movies. I would recommend you to not watch the movie. Definitely a waste of time but also you will come out of the theaters irritated and flooded with the thoughts that if Alia and Varun can be superstars then why cant I be one?!
