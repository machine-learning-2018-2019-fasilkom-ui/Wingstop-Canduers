It was refreshing to see a happy couple (without moaning and groaning kids) move into a new home. The very interesting twist ending unfortunately still does not render this a good movie. It was not entirely bad, but it wasn't good either. The acting was not convincing and got increasingly bad as the film progressed, especially Juli Erickson. Maybe the role was just too big for her. The effects were very ordinary and the film was just not compelling enough, with repetitive dialogue. The approach was more realistic, but maybe it just doesn't work for this type of haunted house film. It was rather bland, actually. At the end, one could say this was the reason why all the effects were so simplistic, but as a viewer you don't know this until the end.
