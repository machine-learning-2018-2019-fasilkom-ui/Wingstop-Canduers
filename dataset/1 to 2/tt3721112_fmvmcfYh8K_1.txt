The movie starts out looking like it might be OK. Ghosts start appearing and you think it might by scary. Throughout the whole movie it is not scary. It seems that the whole point of the movie is for the couple to kiss. That seems to be all they do. There is a gratuitous sex/nude scene at the start. I actually did not even see the end. My wife and I could not even care enough to watch it till the end.
