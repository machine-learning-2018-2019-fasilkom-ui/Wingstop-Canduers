The premise of the film seems to be a 'millennial take on a reunion of friends after the passing of one of their own', ala 'The Big Chill'. Along these lines, its thoroughly unoriginal.I'm not a millennial, so maybe I'm missing something, but these characters are pretentious, narcissistic and just plain dull. These kids are supposed to be early to mid-20s, but they talk and act as though they've seen it all and done it all, and are now jaded and cynical. In the real world it doesn't work that way. But, that's a common thing we see in millennials, attempting to appear to have knowledge and seasoning well beyond their years.Anyhow, the ensemble cast is uninspired. Kaley Cuoco is way out of her league in these sort of dramatic roles. Cody Horn is exceptionally bad here.Apparently Cody Horn had a role in seeing this disaster made. She loved the script and her dad is head of Disney Studios, so there you have it. More nepotism in Hollywood.
