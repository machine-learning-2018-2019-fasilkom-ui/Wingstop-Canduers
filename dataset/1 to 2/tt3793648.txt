I wanted to give this movie a shot because I've long been a little frustrated with not seeing some of my favorite actors from from the 80's and 90's not involved in more acting roles. So, I was excited to see Malcolm Jamal Warner as one of the cast members of this movie. But man oh man, from start to finish, this movie was horrible! What's sad is they had some awesome veteran actors in this movie, Malcolm Warner, Michael Beach, Dawn Lewis, and Tamala Jones. The rest of the cast can go kick rocks for all I care. Seriously, through out the movie, I kept saying, "Just kill me now!" It was full of cheesiness. I rolled my eyes several times. The main character needs to sign up for acting lessons as soon as possible. She is a beautiful woman, but that was some nonsense acting. They had her character crying the entire movie. There was a definite need for balance. The storyline was predictable. I've long felt that Romeo needed some acting lessons as well but I've seen him do better and feels he has potential. A part of me feels sorry for the entire cast because the directing and storyline was just horrible and I sort of feel this made everyone do horribly because I'm just surprised at the acting of the veteran actors I mentioned. Dawn Lewis was the ONLY one that was convincing in her role. Everyone else....nuh uh....not happening. So, I'm think this was just a poorly directed movie and the actors portrayals suffered because of it. I understand that it is easy to criticize. So, I'm hoping the director just pick things and try again and do better in his future projects because this was a mess. My 1 star is for Dawn Lewis in her small role.
