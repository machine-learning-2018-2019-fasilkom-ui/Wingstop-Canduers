Acting is straight out of stage-school. Wooden and rigid. The plot is poor. The dialogue/script is very, very poor. This isn't even TV movie quality.How on earth did Claire Forlani fall from Meet Joe Black to this rubbish? Avoid this. Don't waste 93 minutes of your life.EDIT: I wrote after having watched the first 20-25 minutes. I wish I could now give it a lower score, as the film just got progressively worse... What Claire Forlani's character did in the lift shaft at about 55 mins is simply ludicrous. The acting surrounding an aerial accident a bit later is even worse. I wish I could unwatch this diatribe.
