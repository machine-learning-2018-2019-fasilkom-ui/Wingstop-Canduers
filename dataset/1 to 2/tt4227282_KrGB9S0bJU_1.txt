How does a heavy wrecker tow truck (while also towing another car) consistently keep pace with a 2013 5.0 Mustang GT? The mustang can go 0-60 in 4.3 seconds. The heavy wrecker can go 0-60 in 30 seconds. The mustang's top speed is 155 mph while the heavy wreckers top speed is 75 mph. This whole movie is impossible and boring.
