I wasn't expecting much when I watched this movie. I had low expectations but then I realized 10 min in I needed to lower my expectations even more. This was so bad!!!!!!!!!!!!! The way it was filmed , the writing , the acting. these people didn't get paid to do this did they? Yes, Ana looks great but she shouldn't act. Because she can't!!!!!!!!!!! They kept flashing in on the speedometer of the car and you know it wasn't moving that fast. Became pretty funny after awhile. Now I didn't finish watching it, it was that bad, that I had to turn it off and put in another movie. I will go back and torture myself and finish it at a later time. but , please do yourself a favor and DON'T watch this and spare yourself!!!!!!!!
