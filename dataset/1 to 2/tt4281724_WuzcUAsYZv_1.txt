Watching Terrifier, after all of the hype, was an embarassing experience. Horror fans really need to have higher standards if this is what's hitting their spot; like a nice well intentioned girl you see in a relationship with an abusive sadistic scumbag with an IQ akin to that of pencil shavings.Terrifier is not a film. There is no plot and you could find a better cast in a summer camp production of Grease. The lines of dialogue from its generic characters are delivered with no effort making the whole film feel like a lazy aimless excuse to watch people tortured by a clown.From what I've gathered, this director has been trying to make this Art the Clown happen for years, through various shorts and anthology films. Well some words of advice: if as a filmmaker all you have in your deck is a mute clown with scary face paint and a twisted smile who butchers up one dimensional non-actors, (really, they might as well be mannequins), you should stop making films. This director clearly has no inspiration, and is trying to carve a career for himself off of one half baked idea, poorly executed. Maybe he should be a costume or makeup FX designer, but if this is the future of horror, I hope Art the Clown hammers a knife through my skull ASAP.
