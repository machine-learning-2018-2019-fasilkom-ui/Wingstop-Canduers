This movie was so bad it was funny. I have not rated or reviewed a single movie until this piece of hot trash compelled me to take out my laptop and write this. I feel bad for the actors in this movie because they probably will not be able to find work if any agent views this.The acting was terrible. The movie jumped all over the place. The main guy 'Jake' just screamed swear words the entire time. I feel robbed of my valuable time. Please, PLEASE do not watch this movie.
