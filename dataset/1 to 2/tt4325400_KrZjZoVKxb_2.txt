Given this documentary is about the attainment of speed it somewhat ironic that the pacing of the direction was so slow. I made two attempts to watch this all the way through, but failed on both occasions. The interview soundbites showed a bunch of pretentious gits waxing lyrical, comparing the cars to "the iron man suit" and "God on earth". Some nice views of cars, so it doesn't rate a zero / one.
