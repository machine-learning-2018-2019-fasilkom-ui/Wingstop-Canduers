COLLAPSE is one of those dreadful independent sci-fi/horror movies with a colourful premise and an execution which simply doesn't match. It involves a quartet of characters who hole up in a remote cabin in the woods during end times. The horror comes from a mysterious creature that has designs on them and the film chronicles their efforts to evade it.The apocalyptic elements of the film are almost totally missing on what is a very low budget. COLLAPSE is one of those films which simply features a bunch of characters sitting around in the dark and chatting. Characterisation is nil and the quality of the acting matches that. The direction and script are also poor. There's a twist ending of sorts but it's rather silly and the whole thing is a time waste, nothing else.
