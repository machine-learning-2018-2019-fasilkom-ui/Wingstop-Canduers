I agree with most of other reviews when suggesting that Bruce Willis' name was simply used as an attractant. It isn't anything like normal Bruce films - this needs to be put on the bonfire and never seen again.All the main actors Bruce Willis, Kellan Lutz, Gina Carano, D.B. Sweeney, Joshua Mikel, Steve Coulter, Theodore Sitterson were all good but I feel could have been so much better. The exception for me here was Gina Carano who I thought looked fantastic and was out- acting all others. Also, son-of-willis got a few cuts on his face from a fight near the beginning which lasted throughout, but Gina Carano had a close-range face punch in a car later (with the perpetrator saying "sorry about the face" before he hit) yet she didn't have any marks on her face thru- out the film. However, the one main criticism I have of this film is the VERY ANNOYING and persistent, and persistently bad music virtually ALL THE WAY THROUGH. Don't see this movie. You know you won't get your 83 minutes of life back !
