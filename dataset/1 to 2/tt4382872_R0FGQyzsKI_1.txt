This is one of the worst movies of the year, if not the decade. If this doesn't end Carano's and Lutz' career, nothing will. Dull, boring, totally inconsistent and full of gaffes. They seem to have shot this for a low budget and then had to finish it off in 2 days. There are so many holes in the plot that the viewer is expected to write half the script of the movie. Action scenes are okay, but they look incredibly choreographed and lack credibility. After a 5 minute fight, the actors look as fresh as having come out of the shower. Lackluster performances from all main characters, even DB Sweeney who usually us pretty solid. This movie is a waste of time.
