Acting terrible, music crap and almost every scene predictable from past films. I wouldn't classify this as a film but more of a TV sit com with a long play time. Barely a C rated flick. Bruce even was brought down by the direction and overall scene props. No acting time allowed in this one as most of the scenes are 2 to 5 seconds with zero script and mostly sound effects while the acting tries to impress and communicate via cool moves supposedly from CIA agents and FBI or similar while thugs of sorts give up over little. I'm rather surprised that the great actor himself bothered to make this film especially based on his past films. Possibly the star is not so sure of his worth these days.
