It seemed an interesting idea for a movie, though cliche. Girl is prey, bad guys expect her to act it, prey decides to fight for her life. Very basic, but basic doesn't mean bad. However the writing is at times stupid, and I mean stupid in the sense of its definition. They wrote the several of the characters "having or showing a great lack of intelligence or common sense" and that irritated me. The acting at some points is mediocre, but that could be overcome with writing. In this case I felt I'd wasted time watching this.
