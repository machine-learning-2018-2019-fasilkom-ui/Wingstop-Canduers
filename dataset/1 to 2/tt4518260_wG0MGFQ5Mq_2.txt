Camera, lighting, art dept &amp; locations looked great! Unfortunately, the overall storytelling &amp; tone lacked a steady hand. Great work by the editor BTW who cut nonsensical scenes together coherently. The pacing is maddening as new characters are introduced too fast to grasp all the new lore they try to add with walls of exposition. Costumes look like they were made or bought yesterday. Story jumped all over the place from present day to dreamscapes to fantasy world to portal to music montages and more. I'm not sure what this was supposed to be- Comedy? Adventure?
