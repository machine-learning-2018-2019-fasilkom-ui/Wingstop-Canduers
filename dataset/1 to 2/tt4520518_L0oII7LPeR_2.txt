This was utter drivel of the highest calibre.Puerile acting , no script , awful sound effects and about as scary as the Magic Roundabout.I only gave it an extra star for the decent special effects makeup but thats all it has going for it.Poor old Casper must be desperate for cash to star in this trash but he gave it a bash and it was wasssssh as we say in Scotland. Whenever you see old Casper in a movie you know its going to be a Syfy or Asylum level of movie drivel but this was worse - lets just say he has fallen a long way from the excellent Starship Troopers to this load of old poopers.What is it with horror movies that they all have to end with grungy. heavy metal, brain damage music as well - that just compounded my sore head after watching this travesty!What were the other reviewers watching?
