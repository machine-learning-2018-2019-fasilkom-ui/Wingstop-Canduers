Having read the synopsis to "Loserville", I must admit that I was not one to shy away from this movie. So when I had the chance to sit down and watch it, I did.However, I got up and left after just about 30 minutes into the movie. Why? Well, because nothing at all managed to capture my interest and I wasn't the least bit entertained or amused with what I had witnessed so far.The characters in the movie were rigid and one-dimensional, almost like if they were cardboard cutouts of themselves. Whether or not this was the fault of the acting talents or because they had nothing to work with from the script and director Lovell Holder, I do not know. Nor can I claim to want to find out.I was cringing throughout most of what I witnessed in my 30 minutes of visiting "Loserville". The dialogue in the movie wasn't smooth or particularly impressive. And it causes some very unnatural moments to occur throughout what I witnessed.With 30 minutes wasted, I can honestly say that "Loserville" will not see me returning to it in order to finish the rest of the ordeal that is this movie. I just pure and simply gave up on it and tossed the towel into the ring.I am rating "Loserville" two out of three stars, solely on the fact that the production value of the movie and the editing was adequate.
