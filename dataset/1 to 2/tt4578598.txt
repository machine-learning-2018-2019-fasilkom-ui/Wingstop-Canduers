I can't even call this a movie because it has absolutely no plot whatsoever, no consistent theme, not one redeeming quality at all. I'm positive that there is not a script or screenplay, just a bunch of random scenes that don't make any sense. It is truly the worst thing anyone has ever chosen to put on film. I gave it about 30 minutes just to see if I was wrong, but I should have trusted the opinion I had made in the first 30 seconds.
