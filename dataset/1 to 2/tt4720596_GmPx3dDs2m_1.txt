Time travel films always pique my interest and the premis of this new film looked intriguing. As you'll soon become aware modernity does not guarantee quality. I began to lose interest about 10 to 15 minutes into the film. It is dreadful B-movie rubbish. The plot is hard to follow - if you can be bothered - the dialogue is cheesy and action sequences are cliched. 
 A lot of the acting is wooden and unengaging. I suppose the blame must lie as much with the film maker/director as with than the actors. 
 It should be noted that well known actress and Terminator star, Linda Hamilton has a very small part in the film.. Oh dear I hope the paycheck was worth it and in the future she finds better vehicles than this.
