I should have read more of the reviews. The acting and script we so bad it was painful. They spent a lot of money, had elaborate sets that all didn't mean a thing. Great concept. The writing was amateurish. Even Linda Hamilton was stiff, as though she along with the others had never acted before. Can't believe someone gave this a 10.
