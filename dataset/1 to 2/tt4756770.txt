The "Legendary" movie franchise returns for it's record 14th addition and it's unsurprisingly as bad as you'd expect. Making three Witchcraft movies in a single year likely didn't help matters.All the returning characters have been recast for the umpteence time which kills any credibility this awful franchise could possibly have attained.The excess eroticism has been dialed down somewhat and has left more room for terrible acting, dreadful sfx and more of the usual Witchcraft nonsense.The franchise that simply doesn't know how to die doesn't get any better. The fact they have now made 14 movies and not one of them even remotely watchable is an accomplishment by itself.The Good:NopeThe Bad:Everyone is recast, again!The usual laughable sfxSome of the worst acting yetThings I Learnt From This Movie:The creator must have sold his soul to the devil for real to keep this franchise going since the 80's!
