I went in on this watching just the first trailer some time ago.
I love cerebral sci-fi/horror and overtly weird movies, so this seemed like my cup of tea.But no. It's horrible on every level except for the general idea and some concepts. But as a movie it effectively destroys itself in the first act alone: overt exposition by tertiary characters that we never see again, forced and cringe inducing dialogue. Bizarre choices of editing, scene-placement and a paletera of secondary characters that have interesting stories but are never explored in any meaningfull way.While the first 20 minutes or so set up an amazing cerebral experience, with a great performance from Pattinson, it quickly desolved into try-hard symbolism that is not just hitting you over the head, but also frustratingly hard to follow.There are some cool shots and moments, but in the end 3/4th of the movie felt as useless nonesense that tries too hard to be edgy.
