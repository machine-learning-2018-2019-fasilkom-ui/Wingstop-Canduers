"Bold" cinematic choices make every aspect of this film appear desperate to appeal to some upper echelon of movie-goers. Behind this guise the narrative lacks any semblance of profound or even clever meaning. Unnatural writing and flat performances, taken alongside wholly absurd imagery, make the viewing experience uncomfortable (unless considered facetiously, in which case the movie becomes thoroughly entertaining). Unfortunately, the discomfort felt by audiences seems to be provoked solely for discomfort's sake. Cute baby though.
