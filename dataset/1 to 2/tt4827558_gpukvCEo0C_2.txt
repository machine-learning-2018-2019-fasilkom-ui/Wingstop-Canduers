Horrible, I went into this seeing all the (Fake) reviews, I really like sci-fi/ space movies but this is just trash, softcore porno, and highly annoying,Who creates a movie and decides to put a crying kid every 10 minutes, no one wants to hear that.the spaceship is not believable, cgi is horrible , not realistic, annoying, sick , blah I could go on on on but I have better stuff to do...If you want to waste 2 hours of your life feel free, I wish there was a crackdown on fake reviews this movie is nothing more then a B movie with some ok actors, but script, is just poor and somewhat disturbing when they have to throw in tons of nudity and other weird sex machines.I will be sure to avoid all movies from this director in the future.
