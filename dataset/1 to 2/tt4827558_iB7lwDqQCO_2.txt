This is first time I write review. This movie was horrible, and boring from first minute. Thought that later it will get beter but it was worse. Those guys who made this movie was under some heavy drugs or something, please don't make movies again, go do something else. About movie- it supposed to be something new and different with those sex parts, but it ended boring and stupid. Where is the story? Where is the twist or something? They just died one after the other. Lived boring life somewhere in space, ok reached that black hole and? Thats it.
One of the worst two movies I've ever seen in my life. (Second was the House That Jack Built). Rated it with two stars only because there might be something worse... If it's even possibe. Wasted almost 2 hours of my life, and I payed for it because watched it in cinema.
