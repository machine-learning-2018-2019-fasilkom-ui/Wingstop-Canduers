The movie is boring and so pretentious you ask yourself how it got distributed. It is and empty, pointless effort that I guess tries to cover the issue of motherhood, maybe, who knows, but it goes nowere. There are other movies in theatres now that go nowhere, like The House that Jack Built, but where there there is some fun in the way, some deep comentary, some standout visuals, here there is only emptyness and pedestrian craftmanship. I just feel authors here are just not that smart.
