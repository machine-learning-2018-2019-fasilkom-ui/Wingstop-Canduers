It's good to support Brazilian productions, mainly low budget ones. Horror movies aren't easy to pull or distribute around the country. The locations and settings are okay, and there's value to take from it. But only if you get scared - which is a big thing in horror movies. The acting isn't all that great (apart from the possessed characters), the colors are too saturated, the dialogues sound odd, the sound design and quality aren't consistent and sometimes throws you off. The special effects are okay at times, and really bad at others. I won't go so into the story itself, but the pace, the balance between flashbacks and current events, and the settings for the characters makes the script confusing and not scary at all. The jump scares are predictable too. If you are easily scared, sure, go watch this movie. If you want to drink with a group of friends and watch it, it's also very fun (for the wrong reasons).Not saying it is a hopeless production. The scenes in the dark are done well and there should be more of it in the movie. The director has a good chance of getting better, I believe.
