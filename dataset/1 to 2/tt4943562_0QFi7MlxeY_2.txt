I watched this on prime with great anticipation because we are preppers of a sort and you never know where you might pick up a lesson or two. This was not the movie to watch. I feel like I lost an hour of my life I will never get back. There was absolutely no chemistry between the married couple, the movie used every stupid stereotype of a prepper you could come up with. First time I ever turned off a movie without finishing it. It was stupid and unentertaining. Cardinal sin
