Zero actual research went into writing this disaster. At no point did anyone in the film think to pick up a book or even google "how to prepare for..." and it it obvious the the writers didn't either. The scenes in the gun store and at the firing range would have made anyone, who ever actually had handled a firearm, run in fear for their life of a negligent discharge if they ever found themselves at places like this. Just enough bad information to make sure you die early in a SHTF situation to limit your suffering.
