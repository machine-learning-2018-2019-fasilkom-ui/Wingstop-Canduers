The beginning started out quite well. The lead actor, Jay Bowdy, managed to present a feeling of impending doom with quite a few good supporting extras supporting his role as a teacher. Then.... They had to introduce his wife and the film fell to pieces. WHY??? Once they introduce her and the various people helping them become "preppers" it turned in to a production the likes of which we have all had to watch in work place training videos. After forgettable and ridiculous encounters there is one redeeming scene at the very end carried by an unknown actor playing a believable thug. I had never heard of him but I thought Jay Bowdy did quite a good job with what he had and the film would have been good if he was allowed to carry it himself. Avoid this movie and don't waste your time.
