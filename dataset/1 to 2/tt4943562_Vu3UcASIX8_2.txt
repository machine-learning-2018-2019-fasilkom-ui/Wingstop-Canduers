...that really goes nowhere.This film actually had a bit of potential going in. Independent and low budget can still produce a good movie...it just didn't in this case. Had they taken this as a character study of 2 liberal(whiney) teachers learning to survive in a world of non-entitlement this could have been an interesting watch. Likewise had the film not taken itself quite so seriously, the one or two mildly amusing scenes could have expanded into a watchable dramedy. As it is this is a confused 1/2 story that takes us on a slowly rambling preachy journey to nowhere.Really confused as to why this is rated as high as it is.If you feel the need, watch it yourself and draw your own conclusions(ultimately it is your time to waste)...but only if its free.
