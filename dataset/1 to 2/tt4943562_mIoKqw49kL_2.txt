Mockumentary? Drama? Comedy? Satire? I'm not sure, to be honest....so whatever the makers of this film intended, they failed miserably.Okay, I laughed at the wife slugging the hand-to-hand instructor, Dave at the LGS was funny, and the end credit scenes are pretty hilarious..... but otherwise, this thing is cringe-worthy. I watched a couple of Roger Corman flicks yesterday that made more sense than this film (though I drew the line at Deathstalker II.....even Monique Gabrielle's perky hooters couldn't get me through that one).If you're the type who likes to critique the actions of the protagonists, this MIGHT be enjoyable if you can make it about 2/3 of the way in. It's like a class on how NOT to safeguard your home.
