The reason for this movie's rating is obviously artificial. There are only a handful of reviews and they are biased. Herein lies an honest review of the film.The movie is poorly acted, poorly written, poorly shot, and so heavy handed with its message they get the main character to literally tell you at the end of the movie what they have just beaten you over the head with. The cringeworthy sex related dialogue feels as though it was written by a high school student and is jaxtaposed with so many attempted deep and meaningful conversations that it feels like an alien's interpretation of human interaction. There is no "better part" to this movie the other reviewers promise, the way it starts is the way it ends. This movie is bad. Not in a "The Room" or "Birdemic" kind of way. Just bad. There is nothing here, look elsewhere.
