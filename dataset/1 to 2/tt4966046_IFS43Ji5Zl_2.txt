When a young couple and their newly born child learn that their mother is missing they race back to their home town to assist in the search only to learn that the town holds a dark secret.Sadly the dark secret is never fully explained and the film is an anti-climatic empty 90 minutes of boredom.It's not that nothing happens, it's that nothing even remotely interesting happens.The movie ends on about 50 question marks and that simply isn't acceptable.The Good:Jean SmartThe Bad:Everyone else
