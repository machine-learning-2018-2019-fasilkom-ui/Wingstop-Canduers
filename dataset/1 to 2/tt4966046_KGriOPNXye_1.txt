I don't often write reviews for IMDb but after sitting through 'Awaken the Shadowman' and then reading some of the 9 and 10/10 reviews I had to take a moment to warn the world away from this poorly written, poorly directed 'thriller?' peopled with amateurs posing as actors and the always lovely Jean Smart.The story in a nutshell, an everyman gets a call from his brother informing him their mother has disappeared. Concerned, he carts his wife and young baby to mom's place where they are introduced to a collection of folks who all belong to a sort of survivors group. The everyman then proceeds to spend most of the film searching for mom while 'The Shadowman' basically a black silhouette, turns up occasionally and does absolutely nothing until late in the third act.The ending doesn't matter because if you have ever seen a horror film you already know. Lazy and obvious.Now the big problem. The acting in this film is some of the worst I have ever seen. I know, it's a low budget horror, but the soap opera lead and the rest of the cast give such flat, monotone readings I was questioning if Shadowman was suppose to be a comic parody of the horror film genera. Nope! It's not clever and self aware like Scream, it's just horrible.Next time Skyler get a dialogue coach and a monster that does more then stands in the corner of the room like a virgin at the senior prom.
