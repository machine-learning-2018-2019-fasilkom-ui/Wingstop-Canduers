This movie is horrible. It's slow, excruciatingly boring, annoying...the story isn't interesting, the characters aren't likable, and most of the acting is garbage. I watched it because I'll watch anything with 5 or more stars...how this got 5 stars boggles the mind. To say this is an average horror movie is shameful. Avoid this dumpster fire...
