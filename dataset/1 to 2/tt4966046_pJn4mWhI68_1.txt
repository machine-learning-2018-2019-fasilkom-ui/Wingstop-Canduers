I can't believe I made it through the whole movie. Their voices never changed tone and their was no emotion. I don't this this was bad acting because I believe they were directed to do that. This was one of the slowest, most boring horror movies I have ever seen. There was only one instant towards the end of the movie that I was actually able to pay attention and that was when the main character guy was talking to the woman that didn't trust the people. I wouldn't even call it a horror movie. It was a total waste of my time.
