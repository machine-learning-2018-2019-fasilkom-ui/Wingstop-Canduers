Unfortunately, i have to say don't bother watching this unless you had 99 cents to spare and some time to have a nap.
Production values are good and some nice visuals, some adult scenes and acting is fine, but just nothing to this film .... a poor version of 'Eye's Wide shut' , Fifty Shades and a wannabe Argento movie.
Was very disappointed, and at times bored, some shocking scenes but nothing to save this very lame effort of a film!
