In an isolated island in South Pacific, there is an outbreak in a top-secret military facility where Colonel Aiden Wexler (D.C. Douglas) is researching biological weapon. Ten years later, a small squad is sent to the island to investigate the status of the facility. They shall contact their helicopter a couple of hours later; otherwise the place will be bombed and totally destroyed. Along their journey, they are attacked by zombies and when they reach the building, they find Aiden alive. Out of the blue, Dr. Mikaela Usylvich (Maryse Ouellet Mizanin) that is assisting the mission discloses that is Aiden's daughter."Isle of the Dead" is another lame Sci-Fi production, with another terrible story and awful acting. The zombie story is senseless and the situations are quite ridiculous. Why a military squad with a few soldiers should be sent to a doomed island ten years after an incident? If the intention would be to see whether there are zombies or not, wouldn't be easier to monitor using a satellite? The insane Colonel Aiden Wexler contaminates Pugh and attacks three other soldiers. Why he was not killed when he was found? Instead, the survivors bring Aiden, who is contaminated, with them. My vote is two.Title (Brazil): Not Available
