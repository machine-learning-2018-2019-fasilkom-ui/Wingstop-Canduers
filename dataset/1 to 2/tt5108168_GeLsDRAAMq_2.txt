First of all the acting in this movie is so bad. The supposed SEAL team isn't even close to believable. They look like a bunch of candy-ass high school kids whose balls just dropped yesterday. Between that and the terrible acting, this movie pissed me off very early on. I turned it off very early on and didn't finish watching it.
