Like everyone else said before.. Ok trailer. Interesting story line "Four friends test their intelligence in a game that takes a dark turn." Starts out with a nonsense scene, then comes the actual opening title which is VERY BORING and EVEN MORE BORING. 
Then comes the actual story which starts out ok.. Not good but ok and a little later everything goes total crazy, pointles and nonsense. 
Really. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. 
The acting was ok. Everything else was basicly ok. But that script. Dude. That script is a nightmare. It is like almost the worst ever. How can they pay for it? But for real? I can't really think that anybody actually read the script before shooting. 
And when they realized what a piece of ***** it was it was already too late.
