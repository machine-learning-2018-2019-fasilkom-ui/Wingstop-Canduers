This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen. I was watching this film with about 7 friends, we honestly thought it was a parody at one point due to the ridiciously bad acting and storyline. The first 15 minutes of the film takes place in a restaurant with conversations between the main characters which can best be described as interesting as putting 5 Instagram influencers in a room and making them debate politics. Although, that's probably more interesting than what was spoken about in the film.During the film almost everything was predictable, the acting was bad, the music was RANDOM and really added nothing at all but rather distracted from what the characters were doing and the nudity really also had no real benefit to the film.Near the end we all expected some kind of plot twist where we would go "aha!" where we would understand the reason why this film even was added to Netflix but this revelation did not come.Please, save yourself 1 hour and 30 minutes and go do something useful and enjoyable
