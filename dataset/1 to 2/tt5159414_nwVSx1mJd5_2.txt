I can only guess they didn't have enough money to shoot everything in the script as it felt like watching one of these kind of films with a dozen or so scenes edited out.The production values, photography and sets were pretty good for this but largely it seemed the writing let this film down.I watched all the way through expecting a plot of some kind to develop but it never really did.Early on a character is introduced and a big thing is made of them leaving, we never see or hear from them again, okay a red herring perhaps, but what spend five minutes of the film on it. Things go along pretty much in this fashion until the end credits.The puzzles were mostly not very puzzle like and the fact that the characters guessed and solved what some of them were at all didn't seem very realistic at all other than it being the only way to move the film along.The ending left several loose ends and was ultimately completely unfulfilling.
