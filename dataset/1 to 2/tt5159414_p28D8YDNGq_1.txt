So there actually is a group of people, producers/actors/writers, who consider this movie to be ok? Why in God's name would anyone attach his or her name to this production?<ul><li>What actually counts as an accomplishment is that the start of this movie, the dialogue, is so incredibly boring...as if the production teams does not want you to view further</li><li>Random LA B-actor casting agency did it's job by selecting pretty, stupid, empty 'actors'</li><li>Nothing is fun in this movie; the puzzles are stupid, you never feel involved as a viewer; no scares, no gore...just an empty shell</li><li>There is no clue WHY things happen as they happen, no explanation, no satisfaction, terrible ending</li></ul>This list can go on and onI keep wondering why these movies are allowed to be made. Who gives money for this? How come people involved in this production set the bar so, so low. Shame on you!This movie is an insult to viewers and MUST be avoided at all costs
