I'll start off by saying Fox's 2011 documentary 'Gasland' was reasonably well made and raised some fair concerns about fraking."How to Let Go...' on the other hand, is little more than a hodgepodge of present day leftist mantras with little in the way of supporting evidence. Fox is trying to strike an emotional response from viewers with this material, and his target is really Western Civilization as much as it is actual climate change. We get a glimpse of rainforest destruction in Amazonia, beach erosion in the South Pacific, toxic air pollution in large cities in China,etc. Climate change is of course to blame for all these ills.The problem here is that beach erosion is a natural process, and Fox never makes the case that climate change caused the specific erosion he shows in the film. Again, the message I get is that we're meant to ignore facts and reason, and to let emotion sweep over us.The biggest fallacy in this sprawling mess of a documentary comes when Fox attempts to make the case that income and wealth inequality are driving forces in the creation of climate change. He goes on to provide no concrete evidence of this absurd claim.He ends with this "moral imagination" nonsense. I imagine Chairman Mao and Stalin had tremendous moral imaginations, given Fox's logic.Its hard to know what the exact takeaway is from such a sloppy, disjointed work. My best guess is that Fox wants Western Civilization to die off, and that humanity go back to primitivism. We should emulate the virtue of primitive Pacific Islanders and Africans living in mud huts.This is documentary filmmaking at its very worst, its riddled with unsubstantiated claims, logical fallacies and hippy-dippy, contrived feel good moments. This callow, low-minded material is garbage aimed at uninformed millennials, which, unfortunately, there are a lot of...
