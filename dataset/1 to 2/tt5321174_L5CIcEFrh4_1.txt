Its basically a winking two hour glorification of domestic terrorists like Cliven Bundy.Dry, boring, slow, incomprehensible, convoluted and infuriating are the best ways to describe it.Voight's character at his best is a clueless idiot who has no understanding of the legal system, management, or pretty much anything other than pointing a gun at federal agents.Caan's character is illogical and seemed to be based on Western villains. I'm surprised he never tied a damsel to a train track.Total waste of time.
