This disaster of a film managed to gather very old actors and stick them in La Grange, Kentuck for a few weeks to make a Western. Well, they thought they did, and they HAVE ... sort of ! I almost fell asleep about 15 minutes in, and it quickly got worse after that ... I doubt if anyone connected with this movie would be proud enough to admit it ! The question which must be asked is WHY make it?? And after all the money and the effort expended ... what is there to put about it in their CVs ? Please avoid this movie, even if you have low blood pressure !
