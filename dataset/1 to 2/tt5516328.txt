There is nothing wrong with the acting or the production of this movie, in fact they are quite good.It's just that it's really, really boring and seem to go nowhere. Also I did not care for any of the characters.I sat through it, because I thought the ending might bring the seemingly unrelated stories together.It actually did, kind of. But in the most uninteresting, far-fetched, cheap and stupid way possible. I was surprised alright, but not in a good way.
