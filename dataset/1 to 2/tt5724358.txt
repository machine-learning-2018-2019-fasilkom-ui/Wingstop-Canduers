This film is the worst propaganda sample. The one-sided interviews, specially selected facts, omitting of undesirable facts, manipulating by evil analogies - all to demonize and discredit Ukrainian people and its Will to Justice, Freedom, Independence and Peace. The presentation of events in Crimea during so-called referendum (omitted the Russian troops invasion, unidentified or using Ukrainian police uniform), in Odessa 2nd May 2014 (ommited the presence of Russian Nazists, pretending native, inspiring provocations of violence) and MH17 investigation (numerous fakes from the Russian experts and journalists, which contrary to official results) is not objective but fully copies Russian media.I'm very disappointed with this Oliver Stone's hackwork.
