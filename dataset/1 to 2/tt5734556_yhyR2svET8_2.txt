This film is crap would be a better name for it. It's had ONE 5 star review. I bet it was by the mother of whoever squeezed it out of their backside. I made better horror films in Super8 when I was 12! Basically, some friends go camping, and after roughly 45 minutes, things start happening. To compare it to Evil Dead, is an insult. In fact they'd probably sue for damages. No shock to hear that the budget was $858.
