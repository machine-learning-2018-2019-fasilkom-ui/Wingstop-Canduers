Horrible acting, horrible script, horrible plot. Watch this movie if you have time to kill and need to fill your WTF quota for the year. Easily in the top five of the worst films I've ever seen, maybe number one. Honestly, it's as bad as The Room but the mood is too dark to be funny. The people that made this should leave this industry immediately and see if they can still get into night school. What is this movie about? WTF?!
