... be very afraid. For what reasons you ask? Well that will be entirely up to you. Chances are the reasons will be the wrong ones - a majority of people who've watched this agree, that it's not really good. But that is not my reason for voting so low. It's because I watched it and unfortunately it really did not hold up to the title or a certain B-movie standard.It does try very hard and I'll give it a fair point for trying. But in the end all the effort almost goes to waste. The jokes do not work as well as the movie intends, the special effects are ok for the budget this had. If that is enough of course for your taste. It's really a shame, because a lot of things might have worked better under different circumstances. But if you're only out for "blood" (interested in many watching many different kills), you may get something out of this
