Some indie movies are really good. Some are just horrible and should have been never released. Like I know it might be fun to create your own action movie and maybe to put in online for a few friends, but please - be realistic. There is a ton of very bad movies already, so do not add another one.The problem with this apocalypse movie is this is just a boredom movie, totally absurd, without solid logic, with environment intact, just deserted. The main "hero" is a wimp who would hardly survive alone in an amusement park. The movie is just an hour but feels like three hours long. It is just that dull and boring.Probably the worst part is the dialogue. If the movie would be completely silent, it could at least try to be artsy. Depression, ugly people, boredom, desperation. You know - apocalypse. But the attempt to add some story makes this creation total rubbish.To viewers: Please, save yourselves from an hour of pure suffering. To creators: No. Please, no more. No more, please...
