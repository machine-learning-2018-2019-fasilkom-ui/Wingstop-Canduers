This movie is horrible. The relationship content is the worst, and so is some of the acting. And for anyone saying these relationship stories are real life to them, is even sadder. It screams desperation like another view mentioned, among other things. I'm even disappointed in Megan Good for directing this movie. I understand this is her field, but you telling me she can't do better than this?
