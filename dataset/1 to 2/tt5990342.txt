The horror is seeing the great Chris O'dowd belittling himself to be in this trash.
The jessica character is beyond unlikable...she is...a horror...Making a sign to some poor guy on the subway to close his legs so she can sit down.Throwing some guys laundry on the ground.Just a horrible woman, horrible character, I will never ever watch anything with this horrible woman in it.She is so horrible someone needs to make an app that if her presence is detected in any form in something one is preparing to view, the device explodes.C'mon Chris, you can't be that hard up for work.Don't get sucked into such trash anymore, please.
