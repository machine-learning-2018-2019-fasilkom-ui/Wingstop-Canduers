I love independent films and I have seen many over the years. Although a fan of Molly Parker and some of her previous work, this is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Though I love independent films and understand that an element of beauty in independent films is that it is experimental, This movie had no point and the climactic ending was pointless. Although there was one scene in which Helena Howard's character Madeline had a great scene in which she "broke-down," the rest of the movie was garbage. I refuse to be an independent film fan who praises a film because it is classified as an independent film. Thankfully I had MoviePass and didn't waste any actual $$$ on this movie. Otherwise I would've demanded my money back. At Laemmle's there were about 20 of us in the theatre and almost half left within the first hour. By the end of the movie, it was just me and 3 other people. We all agreed that the movie was pointless, but we had no other plans for the afternoon so decided to stay in the air conditioned theatre. Don't bother watching this movie in the theatre. If this site allowed me to vote 0 I would. Can't believe Rotten tomatoes has given this 88%. Shows how out of touch they are.
