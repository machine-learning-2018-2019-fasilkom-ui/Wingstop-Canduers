The movie critic of The New Yorker said it was head and shoulders the best new movie out there so I gave it a shot. I knew from the first minute it was a piece of pretentious twaddle. I am trying to watch but it is so reminiscent of a student production and not a very good one that I am giving up after 15 minutes. I feel like the little boy in The fairytale The Emperor's New Clothes who can see what the rest of society can't, that they have all been duped.
