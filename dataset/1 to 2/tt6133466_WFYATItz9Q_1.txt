Was this movie written for 7 year olds? The plot, from the beginning, was incredibly poor and the storyline development just got worse and worse all the way to the end. "Make way for the King..."?? Really? The drug dealer who became rich exploiting his own ghetto community is now the King? The hypocrisy of these types of films are so blatant it says a lot about people who enjoy this trash. Do NOT waste your money on this film.
