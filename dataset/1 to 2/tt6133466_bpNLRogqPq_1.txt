OMG! The Purge series has outdone itself. A plummet from grace, far worse than the Saw series nosedive in half the amount of time. Apparently, we are doing so bad in the Black community that we have to turn to the Crips and the Bloods as our savior against the man. I was literally sitting in the theater ashamed. Pure filth. A hot, SILLY, ghetto mess.
