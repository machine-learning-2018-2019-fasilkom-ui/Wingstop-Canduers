My expectations going into be movie were impeccably low, however, apparently, they were not low enough. Do not go into this movie expecting a thorough back story to the beginnings of the purge. Instead, expect a very short glimpse of the beginnings, which is followed by simply another purge movie, that is just worse. I debated leaving halfway through, but I remembered I payed 6 dollars to watch it, and I went with 2 other people. Please save your money, and don't go or rent this trash.
