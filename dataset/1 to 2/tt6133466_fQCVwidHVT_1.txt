If you're looking for a movie jam-packed with bias political propaganda, look no further. If you're looking for a movie with a plot, well developed characters, an actual though out sequence, and yet another movie directed by Tyler Perry, you should keep on looking.Movies are supposed to bring people together despite differences, not fester innacurate depictions of what's already happened/happening in real life. Polically charged movies only set to further polarize the country should be left to inane platforms such as social media, not the big screen.
