I was embarrassed sitting in the theatre. I eventually had enough and walked out! Worst movie of the year. The only positive thing is that, after I tuned it out, I had time to think about the TRASH Hollywood turns out. And I resolved to go to much less movies and be more discerning about the movies I go to. So I'm grateful I will stop seeing these random garbage movies and save some money. Ok I'm ashamed I would see this immoral twisted movie. What is tragic is that so many people see this trash. What is wrong with us to not know better. We should not be seeing this stuff and maybe the will stop making them.
