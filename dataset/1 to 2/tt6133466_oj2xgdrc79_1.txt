Honestly the film was absolute rubbish. Stereotypical characters. No humour. Terrible action. Atrocious acting. Regressive political messages shoved in your face throughout, eg: EVERY 'bad' or 'evil' character being white - often shown with nazi-esque uniform, KKK uniform, black-face w/ red lips versus the 'good' black gangsters in "the hood."Don't waste your money or your time. Regularly go to the cinema and this is the first time I've felt inclined to sign up on IMDB specifically to review/comment.
