As a recreational fisherman raised on the Mississippi Gulf Coast I take serious issue with the portrayal of the non-commercial fisherman. I am neither a one percenter or someone who wishes to destroy the red snapper fishery. It is ridiculous that commercial fisherman are granted the right to take huge amounts of snapper from the Gulf of Mexico while native recreational fisherman are relegated to only a week or less. People from the rest of the country do not have the right to the resources in our local area before the actual locals who where raised on this way of life. I would not expect to take corn from a farmer in Iowa and his family get none. The same way I would not expect a recreational fisherman from Washington State to not have access to Salmon because it had all shipped to other parts of the country.
