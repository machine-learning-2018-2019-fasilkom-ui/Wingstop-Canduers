A friend of mine illegally downloaded this (yes illegally) and boy if there ever was a case for justifying the use of illegal downloads then this is it.Anyone who has paid money to see this amateurish, pointless student project, should be taking legal action to get their money back.It's bad, how bad I hear you ask? Bad even for a student film that obviously cost about $20 to produce.If you enjoy watching home movies with people who can't act, special effects that are just that "special", camera work that is simply a dude running around with his mobile phone on record and lighting that jumps around all over the place, from bad to almost unwatchable, then by all means, give it a try, otherwise, avoid it at all costs.Garbage!
