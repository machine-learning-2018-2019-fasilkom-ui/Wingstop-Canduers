Sorry couldn't spend my life watching all this. It took about 10-15 minutes of bad acting, poor pacing, unnecessary camera shots, poor sound design and lack of atmosphere for me to give up on this.I'm sorry I couldn't give this more time to this, it was bordering on comedy on how bad it all was put together.
