"It Lives in the Attic" is an amateurish very low-budget production that should be rated in IMDb worse than awful. The messed, bizarre and senseless direction, story, screenplay and edition are incredibly bad and the viewer sees scenes totally disconnected that does not make any sense. The "actors" and "actresses" were cast among the ugliest people without any talent in United States. Sorry but the only reason to watch this crap to the very ending is to see how far the pretentious writer and director would go. My vote is one (awful) since it is not possible to rate this garbage lower than that.Title (Brazil): Not Available
