I like almost every Adam Sandler movie. From Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, Punch Drunk Love, and even Grown Ups. No doubt his Netflix contract or career is making him push out lack luster films, even though I laughed a few times with his last release with David Spade.However, The Week of is weak. I did not laugh once in 45 minutes. The acting was labored, the storyline is old hat, and you can only get so much humor from an old uncle with no legs. I understood that it was triumphant casting Chris Rock as a heart surgeon, but he wasn't funny. This is a very disappointing film that is not worth checking out.
