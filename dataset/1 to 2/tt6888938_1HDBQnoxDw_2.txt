What did I just watch?
Well for a start it was a complete bore-fest from beginning to the last second of the end.Whoever wrote this needs to go back to writing school and the direction and acting was as ham-fisted as they get even though it had Oded Fehr in it and he was the only saving grace.I am not even going to mention the quite obvious political agenda that has become so prevalent in the libtard PC agenda these days which seems to infiltrate every film now.This is one of those completely tedious, overly pontificating, tedious British dramas trying to be the excellent Cube on a 10p and a bag of monkey nuts budget and it shows!Avoid this if you do not want to be bored rigid!
