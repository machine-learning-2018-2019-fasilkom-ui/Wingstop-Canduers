Overall, the movie was a good idea, but the production quality was awful. The audio was clipping in multiple places throughout which really took away from the feeling of the scenes involved. Audio aside, the filtering used in the film seemed inconsistent and distracting. It wasn't all bad though, the portrayed message was great, and the songs used were also very pleasing.
