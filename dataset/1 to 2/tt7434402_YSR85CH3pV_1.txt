At an hour long, this isn't quite a movie, and there isn't even a story. The strange part is, there was some character development although the acting is all over the place and it had a slight potential to be a cheaply done indie horror but it just doesn't succeed on any level. Imagine taking any horror/slasher script and the director filming just some of the scenes, people running around, and no explanation as to why anything is going on and then forgetting to film an ending.
It also looks like it was shot on an old video camera and sounds even worse, many garbled scenes. There is low budget and no budget and then there is this. One surprise, the background music was well done. An hour wasted.
