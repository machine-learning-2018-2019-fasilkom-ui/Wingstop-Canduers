If you can combine Foreign locations, Tamil horror comedy genre cliche elements,female characters only used for pleasuring men, Director who thinks he can make a good movie out of this and a idiotic producer who thinks he can sell it (which he obviously did very well) This is what is the end product of that. A cheap,disgusting attempt( i can't even say 'movie).Tamil cinema is digging deep it's own graveyard.cheers to that..
