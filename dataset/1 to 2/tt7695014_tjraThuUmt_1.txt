The first Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster was brilliant. The second was mediocre, all handled by Irfan Khan. The third film is lost. Its the worst. There is no structure. Its as if the writer has hap-hazardously written something in one night like a college assignment just for the sake of doing it. The characters have lost their core. Jimmy Shergill and Mahi Gill have given good performances but there is hardly anything in the story. Jimmy's character has downgraded, become a bit dumb. Gill's character, well even the writer does not know what she really wants. Chitrangana (known to do selective films) plays a useless character for the first time in her career. Absolutely zero contribution to the story (whatever it is). Sanjay Dutt is mediocre, let down by the story. And there is Soha Ali Khan also. I am out of words for her character.The screenplay is lackluster. You actually see people in the theatre checking their phones. Even I did (which I never do). The music is terrible. All songs are bad. Thanks for having just 2 songs. This is the classic Bollywood example of adding songs for no reason. The main culprit of the movie is Tigmanshu Dhulia. We expect decent content from him. But he is the one who has underdelivered. The writing, the direction is boring. It looks as if he just made the movie hastily or just for the sake of making it or for Sanjay Dutt. He has wasted some good actors, and most importantly a good franchise. Well, not as bad as Remo did for Race!
