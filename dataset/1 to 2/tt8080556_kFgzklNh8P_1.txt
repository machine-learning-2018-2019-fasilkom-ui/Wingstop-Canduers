Misleading title. I was hoping for two hours of uncut footage of Mark Hamil and Rian Johnson yelling at each other about what Luke Skywalker's character should be, but it was just a normal behind the scenes documentary. It was well made but it didn't offer any insight into the creative differences between Hamil and Johnson that we didn't already know. You can probably skip this one and just watch the YouTube compilation of all the times Mark Hamil tried to warn us about The Last Jedi. It's a lot shorter and much more entertaining.
