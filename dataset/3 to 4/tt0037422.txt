Hoot Gibson plays the old Marshall who sends Bob Steele out to deal with some bad 'uns who have some sort of scam going on in rodeos in this competent but uninspiring B western from Monogram. It's clearly intended for the Saturday matinée market. Hoot doesn't get to do much, mostly stand around and react, but Bob Steele is okay as the feller who speaks low, speaks slow and doesn't say much. There are a couple of good action sequences -- the stagecoach sequence has some fine riding and stunt work -- but the overall effect is that it's largely a waste of time eked out with stock footage from other western films, some of which look like they were pulled out Edison actualities from the 1900s and fitted out with random crowd noises. Efforts to match film stocks result in cinematography that is blurry and patchy.Even for the cheaper B westerns of the era, this one is hard to take. I'd avoid it.
