This is NOT a good movie.IMO this is the worst of all of them. The plot is nonsense. The CGI is over the top and takes you out of any kind of immersion.The ending is predictable. The characters are bland. There isn't much you can redeem from this movie. I guess some of the ties to the original location is alright. Jake Johnson is cool
