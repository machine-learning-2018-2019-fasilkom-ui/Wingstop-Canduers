The only reason I gave this a 3 out of 10 was the Bruce was in it, and so was Rain. Every time I saw a Jason Patrick I was reminded of Speed 2. Overall, not a horrible movie, but this falls under the premise of "Hey Bruce agreed to do the film, and we got that rapper dude, what's his name... 50 Cent. This should be a hit!" Cliché' after cliché' tended to ruin the flow of the story as well. Daughter in college, goes missing, dad used to be a bad-ass hit-man back in the day. Oh and he killed the bad guys wife and daughter. I think the movie would have been much better if it had been about Bruce trying to avenge his wife and daughters killer. Now that would have made for a much better movie.Poor story lines, bad script, just overall bad. I love Bruce and John Cusack but even they weren't enough to save this film.
