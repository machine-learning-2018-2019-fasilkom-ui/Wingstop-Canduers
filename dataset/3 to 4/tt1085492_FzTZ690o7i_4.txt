I was really looking forward to this film. The cast is excellent and the trailer looked promising. But boy was I disappointed. Of course the expectation was high and so the movie experience even worse (I almost gave the film 3 stars).In short why this film wasn't for me: I didn't care about the main character / The "Lolita" girl made the film worse (and it shouldn't) / The bad guys are really stupid (like in a B movie) / The "good" guy makes ONLY stupid decisions (why? why didn't he ...) ... you get the point When 50 Cent is one of the best characters in a movie something is really wrong.At the time of writing the IMDb cast mentions the main actor really late - you could not guess it (by the way it's not Bruce Willis)
