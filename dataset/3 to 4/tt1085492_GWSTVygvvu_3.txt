Soooo disappointed after watching this movie!We thought it was going to be great, because of Bruce Willis.But not at all... Fight scenes are lame and not slightly realistic, the car pursuit scene is lame as well. We didn't clearly understand the story.Also, the hero was not charismatic at all, neither was he convincing.Nothing in this movie was worth our time. We were three people, one of us was toying with his phone, the other one with the dogs, and myself I fell asleep.Do not watch this movie.You've been warned.
