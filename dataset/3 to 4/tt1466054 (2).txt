I would have liked to give this film a higher rating but contrary to other reviewers, I do not believe that one has to be immersed in excessive profanity and garbage language to "get into" a characterization.Hundreds of early movies have successfully and vividly portrayed "bullish" characters without having to adopt garbage can lingo to create their character as more "believable". Frankly, I find excessive garbage can language distracting and used to "fill time" which could be better used to tell the story more thoroughly.I did like the story, however, just got tired REAL FAST of Dukakis's bad dialog. Again, when an actor has to rely on garbage for language to create their character, something is badly lacking in their acting abilities.I loved Brenda Fricker's character however, as well as the male stripper wanna be -- great characters and placed against Dukakis's over the top, offensive yuck, it was a welcome relief.Tender, fantastic story of what some may consider an unconventional love. THAT at least survives throughout all the bad language miraculously.
