This movie tries to be too many things and it ruins it. For most of the movie, the writer-director goes for blatant over-the-top "really bad TV sitcom" humour. Most of the attempted humour is extremely lame, over the top and not realistic whatsoever. It tries to so hard to be vulgar and shocking (especially the Dukakis character)that even someone who usually appreciates salty and vulgar humour was left dumbfounded by 95% of the attempted jokes in this movie.The more serious/sentimental parts were much better and well done but after portraying the 3 main characters as idiotic buffoons for 70 minutes, we found ourselves unable to care for them as real human being for the sweeter parts, because of it.The 3 main actors also do much better in the few serious parts of the movie than in the over-the-top slapstick that is so poorly written that you can't really tell if their acting was terrible. I suspect it was the material and direction more than the acting, as Dukakis and Fricker are such solid pros.
