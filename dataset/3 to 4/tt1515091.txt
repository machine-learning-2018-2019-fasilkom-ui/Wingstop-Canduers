Let me get this out of the way first: I loved the first film. In fact, for this one I had high hopes especially since we were finally dealing with Moriarty.This film severely disappointed me. The story was disjointed, and there was no clear direction of that story until the very end. They used their iconic cinematography, wild action scenes, and silly humour to carry the film nowhere to the point that both my friend and I were actually bored of it. And that, unfortunately killed the ending for us during which we did not care at all for the characters nor for what kind of ending the film carried. I never read any original Sherlock stories, but I found that Robert's portrayal, though well acted, was excessively "OCD" and "insane" - far more than the first film.I'll be honest - I far more enjoyed Brent Spiner and his co-star portraying these characters on Star Trek the Next Generation than this film.
