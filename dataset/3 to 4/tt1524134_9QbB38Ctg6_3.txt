All over my country you couldn't visit a shop without seeing this flick. When you pick it up you will notice immediately that it says, the monsters from Lord Of The Rings are back. Do I need to say more?I didn't liked it at all, why you ask yourself. Well, there should be a bit of comedy in it, I didn't laugh at all. The only thing that gives my face a bit of a twist was the return of an urine sample. The main lead (Adam Johnson)annoyed me a lot and wasn't funny at all. I'm not used to see him in those acting parts, I remember him from Frozen (2010). The cadet Hobie wasn't funny neither, if youngsters would look at it maybe they would laugh.The orcs did look nice but when the are being shot they are hit with CGI bullets and the cheap kind of CGI, so it shows. And when they attack it goes on and on and nothing really happens. There are a few killings that are worth noticing but it doesn't save this picture. The decapitation was okay but it was too late.It's sad that this so-called comedy didn't work at all for me. Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 1/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0,5/5
