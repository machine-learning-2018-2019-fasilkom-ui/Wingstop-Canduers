Jodi Picoult has written a novel that is eerily similar to the plot of this movie; the crime was different but everything else was pretty much the same. Interesting.Should she have been cited as inspiration or a source for the script? It was OK. Nothing to cry if you missed it, but better than others I have watched.I gave it a 4 for the possible plagiarism, the slow plot, and lack of sincerity for much of the acting.Really? How many more lines do I need?This is crazy to require a line limit. Honestly.
