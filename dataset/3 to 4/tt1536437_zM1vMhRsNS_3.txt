Holy cow was this bad. I had no idea this was so high on IMDb.The acting sucks, the script was horrible and the pacing left much to be desired. It started out so slow that I almost fell asleep at the wheel myself. The Production Design and Cinematography are the stand outs in this film. The whole move looks great and it's nice to see an indie film that was still shot on 35mm instead of Digital. All the sets look really good and I couldn't tell which was a built set and which was a location, which is pretty impressive.There's quite a few more complications and maybe had the film had better direction it might have been enjoyable. But it moves at such a sluggish pace that every twist of the plot just slows it down.To be honest, Rushlights was not a good career move for anyone involved.
