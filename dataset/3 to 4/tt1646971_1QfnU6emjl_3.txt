This movie felt like it was trying to please too many groups and values at once: "tweens" who enjoy video games, kids around 5-6 years who like funny animals and monsters and ... whoever likes pathos and hypocritical morality, I guess.What bothered me most is that the overwhelming message of the movie was: "We talk about peace and pretend to try to keep peace, but our enemies are monsters who have to be killed because they are bad by nature." Hiccup keeps talking about peace, but all of his efforts come down to 2-3 clichéd sentences, while most of the time he ends up waving his sword around in a very video-game style. The movie actually makes it clear that there is a possible way to stop the fight, but then completely ignores it and goes on to focus on power struggle.All the emotional moments are extremely clichéd, uncreative and feel "cheap" and sugary. They make a huge part of this movie. Not much humor, either.The very beginning was good enough - relaxed, cheerful and I thought a few minutes of friendly banter between Hiccup and his girlfriend were nicely done, felt natural. But the more the movie evolves, the worse it gets for those who notice more than the visuals.
