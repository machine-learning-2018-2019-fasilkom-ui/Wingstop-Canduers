A movie about a yokel meddling with a movie that feels like a yokel meddled with it, Entourage took a step backwards where it should've gone forward. The premise was sound. Let's finally watch Vinnie do something, let's see how he handles directing a big film, yes, please. I doubt Vinnie's capable of pulling off a film masterpiece by himself, but watching his entourage step up to help, along with a cast of guest stars, would've been perfect.Instead of something like that, it plays like the worst episode of Entourage stretched out for too long. The best aspects of the series fall by the wayside while the worst aspects get retread and amplified (like the Eric and Sloan on/off thing again, really?). Even Ari is wasted. It feels like someone at the studio thought the series was too smart and made them scrap everything that was funny and exciting, and bland it down for the dude-bros.If you've never watched Entourage, please don't start with this film. If you have watched the series, then meh. It's bad pizza... still pretty good if you're hungry, but it should've been a whole lot better.
