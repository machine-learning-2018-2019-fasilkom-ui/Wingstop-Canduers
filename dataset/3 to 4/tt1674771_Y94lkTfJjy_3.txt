Quite...empty.An extension of the TV series. Ari Gold (Jeremy Piven) is head of a film studio. Star actor Vincent Chase (Adrian Grenier) is happy to sign up for Ari's first film project...as long as he directs too. The project is a massive one and the studio resorts to getting financial backing from a wealthy Texas businessman. Unfortunately, this means the businessman's son gets to have a say in the final cut of the movie...Maybe you need to be a fan of the TV series (and I wasn't, but I didn't mind it) but I found this superficial and pointless. Central plot is quite basic. Sub-plots are even worse. Not engaging as a drama, not funny as a comedy.About the only bright spots are provided by actual stars appearing as themselves. Gives a feel of Hollywood-behind-the-scenes, and the stars are often quite happy to parody themselves.Not worth watching, not even to see what all the fuss was about.
