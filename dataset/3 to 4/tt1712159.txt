Well what to say, this movie was a)dark (as shot in the), b)predictable and c)boring. The movie starts off with the whole 11/11/11 shebang and as soon as it's being explained somehow I started to roll my eyes. The movie was boring until the end and even in the "magical" 11-11-11 mark it just stumbled horrifically. The main protagonist is just unlikeable as well as the rest of his family. And as soon as the other characters start popping up you pretty much guess their motives and reasons for being in the movie. The plot in itself is idiotic and just thrown in the wind. The plot mixes religion with premonitions and literal bible junk and just doesn't come together in any point to deliver any sort of "ah-hah" feeling or a sense even wanting to know what the whole thing is about. All the spooky stuff happens in complete darkness so you see a glimmer of something shiny in the darkness, but the music direction is a bit off so you'll hear the loud "TADAA" music before anything interesting happens. And sometimes it took the music ques to inform me that something was actually happening seeing that all you see in the night scenes is black. All and all I'd say that the movie had no redeeming qualities and just skated by on the entire numbers theme. Bad acting, bad script, bad direction and no suspense all together in one unhappy bundle. But seeing as I've seen worse I'll give a 3 for all of the 11's. Shame on you Bousman, I really expected more.
