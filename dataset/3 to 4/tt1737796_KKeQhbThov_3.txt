This is more of a sad question - what did she say right at the end (the poor diction pretty well sums up the film). It started as something along the lines of wondering "if we're alone" and finished completely inaudible!!!That said (or mumbled.) there was a perfectly good sf plot line in there and Ericcson is always good value but quality was low and the focus was erratic. We saw much of the heroine's martial arts skills but no character development for anybody (who was that scientist and whose corpse was he fondling?).Once again I wonder how films of this stamp ever recoup their production costs - anybody know?
