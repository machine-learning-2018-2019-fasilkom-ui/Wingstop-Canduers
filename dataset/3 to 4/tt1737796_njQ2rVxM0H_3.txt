Wow, ALIEN RISING is a bad movie, and then some. It's a cheap and cheerful B-movie in which the central characters remain locked in a laboratory for most of the running time. The story involves a gifted young woman who has some kind of psychic powers who finds herself abducted by the military for a special job. Her role? To communicate with a captured alien and discover the plans it has for mankind...Despite there being the requisite twists and turns in the tale, ALIEN RISING is really too cheap to go anywhere. The only - and I mean the ONLY - thing this film has going for it is a central role for cult favourite Lance Henriksen, but - and no offence, Lance - he's looking tired and generally disinterested by the whole thing.The story unwisely focuses on an annoying female character for the most part and her attempts at emoting are quite pitiful. Not as pitiful, though, as the aliens, which are among the worst-animated CGI you'll ever see. I always seem to be saying that in my reviews but it truly is woeful here, and I'm genuinely surprised that this was a recent film. Elsewhere, the director constantly makes idiotic decisions, like adding classical music to various fight scenes. The result is ridiculous in the extreme.
