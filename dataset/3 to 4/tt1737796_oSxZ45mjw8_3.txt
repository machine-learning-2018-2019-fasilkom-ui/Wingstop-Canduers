I didn't know they were still allowed to make such movies in 2015!! I mean, if you do get to take a look at it, around 20-30 minutes is all that is needed to realize that this is as cheap as they come. And you know what? I'll stop blaming the budget. Cameron had a different idea for Terminator 1, he wanted to make it like T2, but budget and special effects would not allow him such a thing back then. Wes wanted to make Freddy like the one in the New Nightmare, again, restrained by budget and CGI he chose differently. Results? Work of arts!Therefore, Alien Rising is just bad. I graded it a 3 stars and not 2, because the plot, the origin, had a nice idea that could have been developed into something better. But it was a roller coaster of clichés. Stay away from this one, it really is 3 on a scale of 10. Always a pleasure seeing Henriksen on the screen, I think he could do a lot better tho. One of my favorite actors sinking more and more. Cheers!
