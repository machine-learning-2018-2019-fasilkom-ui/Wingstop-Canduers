This flick started out okay I guess since the idea is that it will involve meth heads. But it turns into a meandering "Pulp Fiction" esque romp that seeks to intertwine the characters.I won't go into to much detail about the main characters except the grandson is just a sad excuse for a young man, as are so many today. In other words, he is typical of the Beta Boy so prevalent. At times, the acting is amateurish mixed in with more professional work. Perhaps if they had left out the third story with the caretaker girl and concentrated on the grandfather and grandson. I kept checking to see how much longer it had to run. The ending made no sense at all. It does show how much drugs influence the young.
