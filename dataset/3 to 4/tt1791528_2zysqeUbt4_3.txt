Not more than 10 minutes in, excited as I was to see this movie, I thought maybe I was loosing my smarts...There is no plot, way too many cameos, it pushes way to hard to be something cool, but falls flat. Lots of non cut a aways....which made it seem like I was watching an acting class. Just didn't feel natural, the pace of duologue awkward, and Phoenix, much as I love the guy, he looked like he was acting... I left feeling like i was back in High School, forced to watch a movie for film class, trapped, couldn't leave, no bathroom break, looking at the clock, and hoping there would not be a quiz later, Cuz I couldn't make sense of what the f*** I was watching....very disappointed...
