This starts off fairly nice, but unfortunately ends up being really bad. And not in a good sense that is. While the male lead character has almost enough charisma to make it all work, you do wonder why the female lead was written that way. Even if you kinda think it pays of in the end, it's at least laughable the actions they are taking.There are some fun moments and this is shot pretty nicely (though one big effect scene towards the end of the movie is cheap CGI, but you couldn't expect otherwise). It's pretty funny seeing the Omen "Baby"/Kid playing in something else. Most won't recognize Miko Hughes, it's been a while since the Original Omen was shot, but it is him and while his character has not much to chew on (no pun intended), he still fairs better than some of the other characters. Also nice to see Mr. Reddick (aka Broyles from Fringe) in a different role. But he can't save the day either ...
