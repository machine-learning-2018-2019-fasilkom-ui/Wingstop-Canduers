I think the movie didn't do anything new, this story was mentioned and offered a lot in previous movies, and the fact that the movie never impressed me because drama movies should be more emotional and affect the feelings of the viewer, and sometimes make him cry!!! The movie was slow and never stirred my feelings. Frankly I liked the performance of Julianne Moore, and the beautiful parental interaction between Lincoln, Margo and Maisie .
