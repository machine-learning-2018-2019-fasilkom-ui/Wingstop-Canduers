This British trilogy promotes itself as the equivalent "in the tradition of 'Asylum' and 'Tales From the Crypt'". That said, you would think it would lead you to some great expectations in an anthology, but instead it leaves you disappointed as this movie doesn't quite make it as a complete, coherent film. The stories, especially the first ("Don't Open the Door") and third ("Time Travellers Knife"), have great possibilities but fall flat in the end. They go along great but ultimately leave you questioning why did the events take place. The second segment ("Over Developed") is just a poor filler with bad acting and horrendous effects. The conclusion to the babysitter storyline is predictable and a letdown. Overall, this movie is the one that "could have been" and this shroud should have covered a much better selection of stories for the time that was spent watching it.
