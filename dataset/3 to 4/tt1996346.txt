The acting for the leads Blair Underwood and Sharon Leal was pretty good although at times he was not so great as I would think there would be more sympathy for his wife. The police officer from her home town was believable. But the rest of the actors were really not very good, often over the top. The female detective was just too much.And I thought it would have more of a Christian theme but frankly I don't see how that contributed very much at all to the plot. Unfortunately it seemed to just be tacked on, was very superficial. I watch lots of movies that aren't specifically Christian but to seem to be Christian but not really have anything to do with true faith was disappointing.
