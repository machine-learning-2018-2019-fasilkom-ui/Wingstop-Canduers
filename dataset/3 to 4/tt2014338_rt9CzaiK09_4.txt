(36%) A documentary with its sights clearly focused more on film aficionados than the typical causal movie goer, which is both the films strength and weakness. Its strength lie in that it knows most people out there will care very little if a film is shot digitally or using film so long as it looks good and is entertaining/well made/both, so it does not really go after that type of film fan at all. This really is much more of a technical and opinion based affair that you really need a genuine interest in the inner workings of film industry to really get anything out of, and if you don't then I'd advise you to watch something else.
