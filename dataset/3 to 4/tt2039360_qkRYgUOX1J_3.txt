Could this documentary have been done with out the musical interludes? The subject of show posters might make it impossible to detach itself from the music part, but if only the filmmakers had done this, I would have been able to finish the movie.Turned off halfway after 40 year old men started screaming like depressed teenagers.It's too bad I couldn't finish it, the artist interviews were fascinating, as well as the parts showing how they screen press hundreds of copies of posters. The techniques and all the different approaches to this seriously underrated art made for some compelling scenes. But then a band would come on screen and you start wondering, "How did these guys get famous, who would possibly listen to this garbage?" and then it would cut to thousands of people looking around at each other as if to say, "No, it's definitely good music, there's lots of people here, it's okay". Unfortunately, there weren't enough art scenes to be able to tolerate the truly awful music being showcased in the film.The artwork was 10/10. Music 0/10. Compromising with 3 stars, if you can watch the movie on mute.
