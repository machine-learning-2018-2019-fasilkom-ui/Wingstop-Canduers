The movie starts out well, but seems to fade halfway through. The conclusion of the movie is overall flat and uneventful. The high school actors seem to really be just that. If they were trying to be unbelievable in their roles and seemed distant from their roles. Michael Angrano and Julianne Moore were the best in this movie, and that doesn't really say much. The characters are extremely shallow (intended), but makes the movie unwatchable, especially when they try out a few plot twists, that don't require deep thought. 3/10 - The jokes don't land, the story is not interesting and the actual play within the movie seems to be the best part of the movie, something which should have been explored.
