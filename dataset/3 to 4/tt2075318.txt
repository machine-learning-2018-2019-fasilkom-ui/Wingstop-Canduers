I watched this movie on a sunny afternoon. I should have gone outside though and enjoy the sun. Instead of that I fought against sleep. Eventually I didn't lose the battle against sleep and I don't know if that was a smart move of me. Sleeping would have been more satisfying and enjoyable. The story is for almost the entire movie just a conversation of two people that had a one night stand. They're stuck in traffic and just start an awkward conversation. That's the story, there is nothing more to it. The two characters are played by Madeline Zima and Joel David Moore. Besides Madeline Zima being a candy for the eye the rest is just boring. Without being a sexist or so I think this flick will please women more than men, I'm pretty sure about that, and that's again without being sexist. A waste of my time.
