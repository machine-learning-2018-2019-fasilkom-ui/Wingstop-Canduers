There is nothing in this film about the trail really, so if you are watching for prep or general info, don't waste your time. There is a lot of crying and cat fighting and it's just sort of painful and unenjoyable to watch. There are hints of pleasant scenery, but not enough to make it worth the time spent viewing it.
