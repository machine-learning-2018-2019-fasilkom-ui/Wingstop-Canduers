Someone is killing off local teens at a Halloween fun house. You've probably seen it all before.The movie is OK at most. I've seen worse, but I've also seen a lot better. Acting isn't to bad but there is no real story, and even though the murders are entertaining special effects could have been much much better.The killer could have been a little faster because some of the characters were really annoying.As one of my friends used to say when we were kids: "Well... at least it was a horror movie."
