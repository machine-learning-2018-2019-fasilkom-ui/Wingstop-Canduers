The story is badly done. The acting is community playhouse caliber. The only reason I watched this was for Danielle Harris. I'm sure the filmmaker knows her value, but she's really only one of an ensemble cast. It would seem more reasonable to have her as the big star of the movie.I think the story is the killer seeking revenge for a girl who was bullied to death years earlier. I say I think because the characters are poorly defined. I didn't care about any of them. The actors read their lines like amateurs, and the characters are all douchy idiots. The only reason I like the kills is to shut them up. The bloody effects are also pretty amateurish. Some of it is laughable.I guess everybody has to start somewhere. This Sean McGarry is starting at the bottom here. There isn't much interesting to grasp onto. Killing people in one of those Halloween scare-arama has some promise. It just needs somebody better to figure out how to do it right.
