Over 70% gave this a 10...All the reviews were raving..I do not trust either....This is clearly a film that has so far only been known by believers in the conspiracy of DeVere as author.. Nothing to link that man to plays or the company that performed them. Nothing in his writing indicates that he wrote like the author of the Shakespeare canon (and no that is not due to lack of comparison material, it is because of the abundance of comparison materials) DeVere's enemies never mentioned him writing these plays, even though they accused him of all kinds of misdeeds..And what was so dangerous about the plays that DeVere had to hide his authorship?? When there is NO indication that anybody was ever accused of writing these (apparently not so) dangerous plays... Not like the Isle of Dogs....This seems a remake of the Anonymous film http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1521197/ Which was very liberal with history...Is there any new evidence?? Does this film ignore the same facts as other Oxfordian ideas?? Does this film invent historical facts?? Probably..
