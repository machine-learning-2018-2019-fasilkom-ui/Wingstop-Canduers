Movies with a four rating for me are those kind of movies that even if they are boring or lack clearly quality-production or dialogue are poor-you can see the whole thing without doing a big effort, if any. That is what happened here.The movie is kind of mysterious because it seems that there is not a lot of things explained, yep, it is that kind of movie although it has some sort of closing. I can not say I did not like it but I found that as I said on the first paragraph it lacks a little quality everywhere.I think that maybe with it could use a remake with a better script and budget.
