I'm all for stupid/cheesy/lame action movies, but this one seems to have intentionally not put any effort into this at all.The whole story of the dead daughter is just annoying and doesn't add to the action. I find it actually takes away as it's useless. Also, the whole divorce between the 2 parents. Again, it doesn't add to the story simply distracts from the action. As does the moms boyfriend. We could have done without him. I mean honestly, if he hadn't been in the movie, if the dead daughter storyline was left out, there'd be no difference. The characters would still be the same as would the events. All these "distractions" I found to be annoying to the point where I couldn't enjoy the movie. Also, a lot of eye rolling dialogue. For example, after Blake is rescued from the car at the beginning, she and the 2 brothers are running in the streets, buildings falling apart all around them, they've seen people get crushed by debris... Ben (the older brother) asks Blake "why do you wear 2 of the same necklaces?" really? I mean, really? groan.If you don't mind something incredibly predictable with no surprises at all (I'm just an hour into the movie so maybe they'll end up all dying!)then go ahead. I mean, it's still Dwayne Johnson! However, there are better "end of the world" type of movies out there such as The Day After Tomorrow.
