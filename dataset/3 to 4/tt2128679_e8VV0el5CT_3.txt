Pretty sure of that. I mean there are a lot of comparisons you could make to the "original story" this is "based" on. Our big bad wolf in this one, is obviously a human being, but he's as evil as they come. Almost comical evil most of the time. He also has an issue with his breath (though he never at any point tries to blow down a house ... with his breath that is of course).You get a bunch of good looking actors, whom you can almost feel sorry for and they have to go through a lot. Jump through plot holes and such things. Not to mention all the "silly" acting they have to do or the convenient meetings/things that are happening all around. It's not the worst movie I've seen (by far not in that category), but the whole thing feels rather like an excuse than a good movie
