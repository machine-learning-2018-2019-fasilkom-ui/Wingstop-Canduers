It starts out nicely, but deteriorates into home alone. I had expected more conflict within the family, and more overcoming of obstacles resulting from the test itself, for instance the precarious water situation. Instead, some relative turns up to simulate an external threat, resulting in the family going "home alone". The TV team showing up is also rather dragged in by the head and shoulders, even if they're quite self-ironic. And of course, there's the religious propaganda, insinuating you should feel bad for not going to church, and the intellectual property propaganda comparing copyright infringement to theft.
