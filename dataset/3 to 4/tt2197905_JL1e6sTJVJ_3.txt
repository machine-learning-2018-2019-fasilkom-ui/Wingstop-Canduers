I tend to be very nice to indy filcks, but god is this terrible, it's almost like the production crew knew nothing at all about film making, nothing.IMDb says a budget of $150,000. I'm really hard pressed to believe that. watch a movie like primer that was shot for $7,000 and you wonder where the other $143,000 went.No character development, terribly cinematography and effects, NOT REAL ACTORS and it goes on like this boring as all hell. If this was a side project for a kid out of highs school I would say it was a valiant effort. but if this is a serious offering from a "film maker" it gets a 3/10 from me at best.
