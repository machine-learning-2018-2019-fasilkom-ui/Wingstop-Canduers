Well as speculated and rumored previously that this film is a copy of 1999 Hollywood blockbuster 'Face/Off' have been proved as partial truths as the movie is not a copy but rather an inspiration from that flick. When it comes to the plot , the film has two different stories , one for first half and the other for the rest and connected through an incident. It's like watching two movies for a single ticket. One story is the same old revenge flick while the other one is society and evil based. Ram Charan as usual , rocked with his dance moves. Kajal , Amy and Shruti did okay with whatever they had to. Jaya Sudha gaaru just made the mother's character even more powerful with her performance. Sai Kumar gaaru were just an added attraction. Without Allu Arjun this movie isn't possible , hence a special mention. Screenplay was routine and cinematography was just good. DSP rocked it all the way. Director sticked to the basic mass masala formula that is running in TFI presently and didn't at all try any new things , precisely routine direction.
