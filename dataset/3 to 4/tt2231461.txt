Your typical giant monster destroys the world movie.The movie is filled with cliches, the characters are very poorly developed. I didn't care about a single one of them. The Plot is also pretty lousy and extremely predictable, especially the ending.One good thing I would say about this movie, is it is filled with lots of action and good effects.Other than that? It fails at everything else.
