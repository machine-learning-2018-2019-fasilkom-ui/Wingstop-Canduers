George Eads plays a charmer and professional poker player who gets involved with the underworld of Las Vegas and an accidental killing. This is a slow moving neo-noir, but well photographed with some good visual effects and an atmospheric soundtrack.
Steven Seagal and Vinnie Jones don't feature much, bu then none of the other stars do either. It has a few cursory twists and some moderate tension as the second act gets going but really there's just not enough of it to invest in - not much really happens. The ending is a bit of a stub and a twist too far.
