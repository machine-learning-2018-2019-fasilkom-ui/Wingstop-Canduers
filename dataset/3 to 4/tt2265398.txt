We just watched Drinking Buddies and we are still perplexed. I cannot agree with the reviews that rate this movie a 9 or even a 10 out of ten. I didn't know until I read one of the reviews that the dialogs were improvised. I should have known, because most of them were just awful. There is a reason that people like Hitchcock spent up to 5 months to create the script and the dialog, because without proper words the interactions seems to be totally useless. I still think that all the main characters were played by good actors, but a good actor is not necessarily a good improviser. I like independent movies and will continue to watch them, but next time I will read some reviews first. I give 3 out of ten, because the basic idea for the movie was good, just the realization was very amateurish.
