The title describe how bad the acting are and how clueless &amp; dumb these actor looks like in the movie. Even the movies by The Asylum have better acting &amp; story writing than these film. The movie is on low budget, no doubt about that so I will put that aside and review it as a low budget film instead of the big ones.To tell the truth, if you expect an action-packed movie about vampire slayer, then you will be disappointed with how crappy the choreography is. The fighting scene are so bad that I rather label it as romantic/fantasy than an action/fantasy. But the story is quite unique in the way it tries to explore the human side of the vampire rather than just focusing on the evil side. An of course there are romantic part of it that I found more enjoyable to watch rather than the rest of the movie.To summarize it, watching this movie feels like putting a knife on my stomach, stab it in and slicing my stomach open as I make a horizontal cut. I've never committed seppuku before, but after watching this movie I know how it feels like.I give 3 star because the romantic part of it are convincing, the story are unique compared to other vampire movie and lastly because the actress who play Alina is hot.
