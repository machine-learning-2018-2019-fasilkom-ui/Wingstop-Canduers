I admit that a small part of me is rating this movie poorly because I am not part of the target audience. But another reason is that the teen love stories from my adolescent years were way more intriguing. Movies like: A Walk to Remember, 10 Things I Hate About You, and even Cruel Intentions, were far more intense, had better dialogue, and were more memorable. It would be impractical for me to rate this flop higher than those prototypes. Also, no one can film a successful romance without chemistry between the lead actors. The female lead was bland! Clearly the director ignored her lack of expression for the sake of her pretty nose and lips. The male lead only had one expression, confusion. Even when he smiled, it seemed like he didn't get the joke. At one point, he knelt down to look at a fleck of dust when he was supposed to be distressed! The rest of the cast shouldn't have to carry the film because Juliet is monotonous and Romeo's open mouth is drooling. Anyway, who am I kidding? I guess the dull girl is supposed to end up with the confused guy; but my glass ball tells me they have some quiet dinner tables in their future.
