i've seen the same sort of thing come out of the right. makes many claims and assumptions; provides no proof of anything. mindless dribble that will only pour fuel on the fire. tailored toward the unthinking masses yet highly unlikely to spur them to action. jumps around from one thing to the next. no continuity.i wouldn't say that it flat out tells lies, but it doesn't make it easy for a thinking person to believe any of it, despite how much they might want to believe it. we the people must be better than this if we are truly to overcome the powerful influences of money. then again, sometimes it is easier to just start bashing and throwing things.the irony is that the same people who would be offended/angered by this film would probably eat up the same type of garbage which supports their own way of thinking. in either case, nobody is really looking to find out the truth and nobody cares about doing what is right, except in their own eyes....and that is precisely why humanity is doomed.
