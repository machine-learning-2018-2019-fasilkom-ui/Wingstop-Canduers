I wanted to like this a lot. I heard it wasn't your typical "Christian" film. I grew up loving Rich Mullins and was lucky enough to get to see him in concert in my early teens. His music and life had a profound effect on me, leading me to finding Brennan Manning's book and well, just showing me that life isn't as simple as church often makes it.The problem with this movie is its just not very well done. The acting is mediocre at best, the writing is as well. Some things are set in the correct time period and others they just appear to shrug and say "oh well" and don't worry they aren't. The movie also does a pretty terrible job at flowing. We get a glimpse of Rich as a kid, it was rough, his dad was a hard man, and then, he's smoking, and then he's off at Bible college, and then he's in Zion. Stuff happens, and you sort of see how they're connected, but they don't flow into each other.I really wish this movie had been a real documentary instead of poorly made docu-drama.Rich Mullins is an inspirational figure who shared his genius and God's love with the world while battling extremely human flaws. He didn't hide from them, and fortunately the movie doesn't flinch from them, but neither does the movie do a proper service to the man and his work.
