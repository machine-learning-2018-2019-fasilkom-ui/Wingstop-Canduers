Masti had some substance in it when it released almost a decade ago, but its sequel gasps for a fresh story and only delivers adult humor with no furnishing at all.The characters seem like they jumped out of American Reunion (2012). The whole plot is somewhat derived from it. The characters follow their usual air and continue to do for what they had previously learned a lesson (in Masti c. 2004). Women in here, not to mention, are treated as objects and don't induce humor. But, the massively vulgar jokes on them, do. Popular SMS jokes, obscene one-liners &amp; merchandise which give out a witty remark is what Grand Masti is all about. In order to put the film in line with the title, the makers have used the word "grand" a couple of times and the use of fireworks, waves &amp; screw-driven into its cavity mostly depict the same.Cast performance is fine, and all three lead actors portray slightly exaggerated beings of their older selves. Actresses are pure flesh show, be it wives or paramours.Certain sequences are borrowed from Austin Powers, Agneepath, No Entry &amp; they give it a worn-out look and totally drive the audience off the screen. An average 3.3 out of 10 for the effervescent sequel. I also do suspect if it crossed the line.BOTTOM LINE: Much like expected, Grand Masti delivers vulgarity, but at the price of poor plot &amp; clichéd conclusion. Perfect for a mild laugh with like-minded friends to bust stress.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?
