I'm a pretty forgiving fan of movies... This is great for teenagers maybe. But for adults, don't waste your time. It's a vapid, meaningless script, with characters that are easily forgotten. Not scary at all. No depth. No weight. Just a waste of one and a half hours. I can't believe that it got a semi high rating. Seriously. This was a cheap, and dumb movie. By cheap, no class. It reminded me of a haunted house on Halloween that you might go through in your neighborhood. Just all around bad taste. This writer/ director has no vision. No tension either. I mean. There is nothing here. Not one likable character. No atmospheric horror. No real story. No mystery that you're interested in. This is just emptiness. I think a bunch of Tweens or teenagers could like this. That's about it.
