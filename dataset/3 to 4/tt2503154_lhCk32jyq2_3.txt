This movie doesn't live up to its rating. It's a take on the found footage genre using mostly the perspectives of laptop and cellphone camera.The viewer is supposed to feel like watching most of the scenes in realtime. Interesting concept, which doesn't play out. This movie kept me barely interested. The storyline doesn't create tension and is void of twists and major surprises. It just unfolded like I expected it to. According to some other reviewers this could be understood as a viable statement on the dangers of the internet. I find that laughable. People should be concerned about other aspects of the net than that. The tale of the anonymous killer has been told before - the movie doesn't offer anything beyond of that. 3 Stars because the idea of connecting the viewer to a live-feed as a willing witness is good, but just a concept. Also the last scene contains something like a statement of critical value.. certainly not enough to justify the drag. The "banality of evil" is a good quote with which to end the movie, but two good ideas don't make a movie float.. This production is made up of little besides the basic idea. No memorable performance on any level - fast forgotten flick.
