First i want to mention that this movie has 3 reviews so far, and the 2 of them, are probably written by someone from the staff of the movie, cause both are so obvious and fake written. Especially the one with the "Warning" title. Not even a 5 year old kid would write that kind of review. As for the movie, i have to say it was boring watching it for barely 74 minutes through a web cam, smart phone cameras, mobiles and some other similar contrivances. Well yeah, it has to do with found footage stuff, but still, put a new idea on it than the usual "watching through a mobile to make it more real and scary." The story could and should have been better, but it has some empty spaces and questions while it unravels which ruins the whole attempt making this movie good or giving you something somewhat different idea or plot. The good thing, The Den has, according to me, is showing and exposing world's addiction and stupidity over the internet and social networks and chatting. Without people knowing who they're talking to, or who that person is, they expose their selves and revealing things, personal things, for no reason, just because "that's the way it is" with technology. Posting where they're about to go, where they live, what they like, uploading photos and videos of their lives and from close friends lives, can be hazardous and worse, cause they can't know what intentions have all these unknown chatters. And some of them, or many of them, might be hackers and good ones, from those who might want to mess seriously with their lives. Also it has an obvious similarity with the Hostel movie, right at the end.Overall, it's an uninterested movie, and i don't recommend it. Only to curious ones.3 out of 10
