Some of the actors are good...some are terrible...but overall it is just like watching a student film by a Game of Thrones fan filmed with people who are taking an acting class at their local community college. The lighting isn't bad. I spent a lot of time watching it trying to decipher whether or not it was just the budget that was making it bad and I really think that is nothing to do with it (although some of the costumes were like something ordered off of Amazon.) However it was really just the writing and the acting that ruined it. For example the lady that played Esther...are you kidding me? Just awful. And the guy that played the eunuch proved the makers of this movie watch a lot of Game of Thrones. Obviously some of these people got their parts because they knew the people making the film.
