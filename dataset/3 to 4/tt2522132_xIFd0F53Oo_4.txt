There must be a gazillion films out there where someone dies and leaves a will,
the provisions of which can be described as off the wall. The Hemingway family
is the beneficiaries of such a will left by, no pun intended Papa Hemingway the
head of the clan.The family owns a publishing empire like Time/Life, but other than a religious
magazine none of the rest of the newspapers and magazines are doing that well.
In the age of the Internet where people get their information on line and on television the empire is tottering like the Ottomans of the 19th century. All
the late family patriarch wants is for his feuding heirs to settle their differences
and pull together.Richard Moll from Night Court playing the lawyer, Alan Thicke from Growing Pains as the son, and Charlene Tilton from Dallas as the estranged former wife
are the names you'll recognize. The rest are fairly unknown, the various members of the next generation.As this is a Christian movie it can only go in certain parameters and those parameters are strictly adhered to. My big question is why didn't this bunch develop on line publications?
