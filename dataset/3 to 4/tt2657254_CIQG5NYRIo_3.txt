Not a movie I'd recommend. Felt disjointed and strange from the start, but like it would get good....which it never did. Honestly it was a bit depressing. A bit dizzying too as the shots are most all rather shaky. Would have given it a few more stars if it didn't leave you feeling all was a waste. Not a movie for those wanting a happy ending.
