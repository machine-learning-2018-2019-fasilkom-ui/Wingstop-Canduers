Main Tera Hero is not at all up to the mark. The movie is another typical Bollywood Rom-com which fails to entertain. It is blessed with only a little number of sequences which possess good humor. Besides this, it just disappoints you. The story tells us about a flamboyant youngster who travels to Bangalore to achieve a degree but instead finds the love of his life before a heap of illogical chaos unleash. Performances are mediocre and some episodes exhibited are awfully bizarre. The actors in performance are neither highly impressive nor depressing. Varun Dhawan, in his second film was seemingly fair to middling. Opposite him was the lovely Ileana D'Cruz who doubtlessly managed to make a hit. Nargis Fakhri, who was another integral part of the story line was absolutely unsatisfying. Supporting roles enacted by Arunoday Singh, Rajpal Yadav and Saurabh Shukla were garden-variety. Anupam Kher in a minor role was strictly ordinary. David Dhawan has been successfully managing to provide us with films containing genuine comicality, but over the years, his flicks are getting worse. It was Chashme Baddoor last year, and this year, it is Main Tera Hero. Screenplay was simply absurd. Editing and Cinematography departments have probably managed to hit the spot. Music by Sandeep Shirodkar was slightly above average.In short, the movie is silly and nonsensical. It might have worked out for me if the makers would have chosen to enhance the plot equipping it with some sort of basis. Watch it only if you are in love with typical Bollywood entertainers. Elseways, avoid it.
