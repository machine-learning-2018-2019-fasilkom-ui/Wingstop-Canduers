As with most movies, the last twenty minutes are where the good stuff happens and things are wrapped up. In this case, the last twenty minutes got a bit confused. There was a definite conclusion and it seemed to fit the rest of the story, but it had more potential and it left a lot of questions unanswered.Things got weird in a hurry and then sort of slipped into another movie.In any event, the acting was pretty decent and nobody got too melodramatic until the last few minutes. The scary guys were a bit weird and overdone. The ultimate ending was a bit odd and there was no explanation as to why the other players couldn't do whatever by themselves.If you can see it for free, it's not too bad.
