OK, so I know this film is aimed at the younger audience but does it really have to be so cheesy and clichéd? From the get go I realized that it was going to be only for the younger audience and us older folk would just have to grin and bear it. There were numerous times throughout where I felt the hairs stand up on back of my neck and my cringe meter when full throttle. I.e Pete howling like a wolf and when some non important character states "Let's go catch a dragon" I'd like to say the kids will enjoy it but there were two sitting in front of me that were clearly getting bored after 45mins. Average film with average acting
