This film is genuinely funny. There's a beauty in not taking some things so seriously. Conjoined definitely offers a solid ninety minutes of laughs, and even a few concerned looks. I think this would be a great title for Netflix. I imagine a group of friends with a twelve pack of beer would find this movie a very great source of entertainment for their late night get together. I'll add this. I personally think the film goes perfectly smooth, like a great wine, with a very serious movie like There Will Be Blood, or even 2001: A Space Odyssey. No, seriously watch THAT triple feature and put Conjoined right smack in the middle. Or, just get a twelve pack, and you'll be fine.
