The new Transporter, who comes in the shape of Ed Skrein, has some big shoes to fill taking on a role that helped make Jason Statham a bona fide action star. I've only seen Skrein in one previous film, whilst I've seen nothing from director Camille Delamarre. But I'm certainly more familiar with Ray Stevenson, who plays the father of Frank Miller, a.k.a., The Transporter. In this regard, it's quite obvious that a Connery/Ford father- son dynamic has been sought, which gives the tiniest bit of personality to a film that falls completely flat from the onset and rarely picks up. The story is familiar -- the Transporter gets a job driving a package, the job goes wrong and he's in deep. It gets personal when his father is kidnapped, but with no grit on its wheels and Skrein trying in vain to create a new persona for this character, what it ultimately amounts to is flash cars, sexy girls, suits and stunts, but nothing more. Much like a glorified car advertisement.
