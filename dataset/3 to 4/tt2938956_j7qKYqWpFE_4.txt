It's sad to see this movie flop this bad, really. It really had the huge risk of at least deliver something equivalent of the original trilogy. But doing this movie without any of the previous trilogy's creative minds is really a big mistake. The people behind the creative process for this movie clearly didn't know what they were doing. They only tried so hard to recreate the Jason Statham's Frank Martin persona with the mannerisms and the unique fight sequences. But in doing so they really pitted Ed Skrein with the old Jason Statham performance, on which everyone can really choose who's the winner. Not having Jason Statham is by itself a big burden due to Ed Skrein still fails to live up to the Statham persona. The story also seems very flat, nothing new or unpredictable is being offered by this movie. And the biggest sin is the editing.there are so many editing mistakes that takes away the fun in watching the action scenes. The acting overall is so bad that I don't deign to write about each actors' performances.
