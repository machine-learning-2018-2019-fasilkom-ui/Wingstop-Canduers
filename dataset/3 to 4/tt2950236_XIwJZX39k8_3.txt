Watched it because of love indie films. I finished the movie, wondering "how did I end up wasting my time with this one?" I am not a movie reviewer but I just simply had to put my two bits in on this one! I hated it. Low budget, bad acting, poor directing, bad sound, bad picture. Yuck!Make-up was horrible. How did this get on my list of movies to watch?I sat through 90 minutes of wondering if a plot would thicken or a twist would come. Never. The movie didn't improve from the first minute. It just went on and on, into nothing...I don't even know who the main characters were. Not one of the actors stood out as anyone to follow in the story. Not one of the actors showed any sign of acting ability. I will try and make sure to never watch anything with any of the actors that were in this film or even involved in the production. I just wish they could all be blacklisted for me. Spare us all, please.
