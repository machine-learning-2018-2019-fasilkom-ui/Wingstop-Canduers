I don't know what's worse... the fact that this movie is an absolute mess or that I wanted to love it and it left me with blue balls. The lighting is awful, the editing was done by a blind and deaf person, and the ending makes zero sense. The only reason it got as many stars as it did was because they did manage to corral a lot of horror legends into one place.
