I love low budget horror, even the lowest of the low and have an appreciation for 'so bad it's good' cheese-fests. This movie is so bad that it is basically unwatchable, and it doesn't help itself by having editing that makes very little sense.For no apparent reason the story is broken up into chapters(?) that don't really correlate and don't help to reveal anything or enhance the story in any way, so I have no idea why they didn't just make a linear film. Sure, there is actually very little in the way of story to tell, but at least you could have made an average lame horror movie, rather than some chopped up piece of garbage that thinks it is saying more than it is.Finally the premise, it barely has anything to do with what happens in the actual movie and the smothering plays so little a part that it is nothing more than a gimmick. There is nothing redeemable about this movie apart from the names in it and they are completely wasted so that means very little. I was really hoping this would be a fun horror comedy watch and it just wasn't, it was a pain to sit through. Avoid!
