You've seen them haven't you? Fabulously beribboned in colourful satin silks and gold and silver trimmings. You pay through the nose for, as you guess, six hand made chocs. You nurse your little package all the way home, make a brew, sit in your comfy chair and prepare to delight in the little delicacies inside that tempting box. Whoa! You lift the lid and wail-oh-wail it is empty! Such is this film. Nice packaging but there is nothing there. Nothing I tell you. Someone left a Christmas cracker joke in there instead - not even that funny. Oh wail wail wail. Been conned before - why didn't I spot this for what it is. Grown ups playing in the dressing up box, that's all. You don't get to play along at all. You can sit in the dark and go to sleep instead though.
