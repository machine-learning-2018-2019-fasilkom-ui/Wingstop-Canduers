Had my interest in the beginning where the lead made a funny joke and thought that yeah that seems like a cool guy this can be alright.But no, besides that joke and one other the lead character is pretty boring and doesn't do much in this movie except walking around in Memphis and mumbling to himself, and makes some blues music of which it appears that he sees himself as a musical Messiah.A lot of scenes he's not in it tho, tons of random scenes of random Memphis people doing random stuff, mainly kids playing around.I don't really see the point in all of that, I get the feeling that some of the stories told by the non-leads are true stories which is fine and all but why not just make a documentary about random Memphis people instead of making a movie about them, especially since not a damn thing (more or less) happen in the movie.I don't mind slow movies but at least fill it with some characters that are interesting and good dialog.The visual look is pretty good, but really most times this movie feels like watching paint dry.
