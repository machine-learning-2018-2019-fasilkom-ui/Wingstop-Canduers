Drama, family and romance are the genres given for this movie. I would add mystery to those. There was a story evolving during the course of the film, it was not great but it kept me watching. Unfortunately, it dissolved at the end into a pile of plaintive questions, but then, as if to redeem the movie, the happy ending...I think...I'm not sure how they got there.The whole thing was a bit tentative. The acting was pretty good, Eric Roberts appeared briefly near the end, a cameo performance. If the story just had a transition of some sort between the climax at the peak of the action, to the happy scene at the end, it would have been OK but there was not..it did not..really explain how they got to that point. Or maybe it did and I missed it.It was a novel situation, it could have been a good film but in my opinion that glitch at the end spoiled it.
