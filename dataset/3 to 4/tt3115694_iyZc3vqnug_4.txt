If you're the sort of person who drinks lame wine with your neighbors before you pick up your kids from public school that pretends to be private, then you might like this. Sorry, it's incredibly slow when it comes to plot development and even slower when it comes to revelation.It's a good enough movie if you have absolutely nothing else going on in your life for the whole 78 minutes. I'm not one of those people married to a phone or tablet. I have three kids and three girlfriends, it took me over six hours to watch this boring mess.The premise was OK. No, really, it's cute and unique. Delivery took forever. Result was like masturbating and giving up in favor of a nap.
