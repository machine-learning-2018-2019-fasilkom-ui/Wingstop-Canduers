Film Review: Creedmoria. Winner of over nine Awards since its 2016 debut, one would think director/writer Alicia Slimmer's family oriented coming of age flick would be a hit right out of the gate. However, after spending a painstakingly 1 hour and 30 minutes watching this 1980's inspired ameture production, one can only think 2016-17 was a slow year for Indie recognition! From the opening scene to end, this film is overacted, over staged, over costumed, under directed and just one cheese barely related scene after another. Candy (Stef Dawson "Hunger Games" I &amp; II) and her brothers closeted Sean (Ryan Weldon), drug addict Danny (James Kelley "King Cobra") and unhappy nurse sister Marie (Giuliana Carullo "Life in Pieces") live in a home with a wacky and verbally abusive mom (Rachel DeBenedet) and a pushover dad (the usually interesting Ray Abruzzo "The Soprano's"). As Candy and Sean try to come to grips with youth angst, the local state mental institute and a few wondering patients are tossed into the mix. Director Slimmer's answer to bringing any sense of realism to the mayhem, is to toss in a few male cutie pies like restaurant patron Eddie (Tommy Nash) and Candy's love interest Billy Fenton (Steve Cavanaugh). However, tossing in a pretty boy here and there does not make a successful movie. "Creedmoria" is an over rewarded film that doesn't warrant any further attention.
