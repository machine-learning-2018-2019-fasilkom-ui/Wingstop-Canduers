I'm a huge grassroots, Saturday night racing fan. I was very excited to see this after seeing the trailer. However it is painfully slow, poorly edited and an hour plus of my time that I won't get back. It gets a three with me because some of the interviews are very good. However most of this is just long silent shots with absolutely no context. Just adding a narrator to this would have dramatically increased the reviews. Such a disappointment.
