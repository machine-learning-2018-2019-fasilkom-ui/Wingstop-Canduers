The life of Dan Eldon is a story and adventure and tragedy which has all the ingredients for a great film adaption. Sadly the director here was not the man to carry it off, running scared of global and sensitive politics and badly misjudging the aura that the art direction would cast over the film. It plays more like a Sunday morning teen safari report for some children's channel. The first hour or more is done so poorly that you could actually skip it without losing anything of the film. It is littered with cringe-worthy moments with actors who look no older than 14. The seriousness of a life of photojournalism and art in some of Africa's most poverty stricken and war-torn countries is completely overlooked in exchange for teenage safaris and soppy scenes of light kissing and rolling about. The film does improve a little when we finally get to Somalia, but is still a major disappointment and still cops out and purposely evades the sensitive issues of international politics, religion and culture which all combined to result in the death of 4 respected journalists. I just hope that if ever I get hacked to death that this director doesn't direct it. Give it a miss... You'll be missing nothing.
