This is worse than part 1. Part was wasn't too bad, but this is plain awful. It is wrong on many levels - the plot is incredibly weak, the acting is awful, and the script is straight out of a 70s B movie. In an alternate universe this movie star Jean Claude Van Dame. However in this universe Tom Cruise appears to have failed miserably, as did direction, script writing etc.Corny lines like, "They ran out of Medal" when referring to how heavily awarded this former MP is, happen to be just one example amongst the many.Then there is the plot, the pointless proactive attempt by the bad guys to lock up and kill Major Smulders, follow Jack Reacher, create a professional baddie that takes things personally. This may well be the tipping point decline in the career of Tom Cruz, he just looked past it, slow, completely unbelievable.I won't say much more, this movie isn't worth wasting the time on the critique.
