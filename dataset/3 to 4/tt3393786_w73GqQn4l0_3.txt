My wife convinced me to go, even though i didn't not much like the first Jack Reacher movie. I do like Tom cruise in general though.The plot is very generic, i mean like we haven't seen something oh so very similar a thousand times. No surprises along the way.The action was extremely poor, Jack and his sidekick consistently not carrying weapons even though their opponents are and even when they beat down their opponents (who have guns) they don't then pick up the gun and take it with them (ok maybe they did once). There was a scene where Jack is fighting the professional killer, The dialog was boringly average, as if to just stretch out the movie, most of it not really having much to do with the plot or moving the movie along.The girl is hyper annoying, keeps getting into trouble, Jack has to save her yadda yadda yadda, except if Jack had acted as smart as he is supposed to be, he would have made sure she didn't get into said trouble in first place.Worst movie i have been to in quite a while.
