I have only seen this at least twice,
and I find it alright at best.I will say that I do like the concept about
duel gun-fighting done this way, and since
this was written and directed by the man who wrote
"The Replacement Killers" I figured, why not
check it out.To my surprise, I find it entertaining enough
but lackluster and forgettable at the same 
time, which is a shame because the concept
is really cool.I think the writer/director should have made
this film way more fun because it just lacks
in so many ways, like, their isn't enough character
development, not enough story, too many inconsistency's
in the story like why does the duel gun-fighting tournament
exist, why dose John or Colt participate in the tournament,
why isn't there more action scenes, why is the pace so slow,
and why is the main villain only shown the last 9 minutes of
the movie before it ends, among others.Overall It's just alright at best but forgettable,and lacks in
more than a few places.I give it a 3/10. Not great but watchable, if you have nothing
better to watch at least watch on a rainy day.
