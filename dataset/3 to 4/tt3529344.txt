An interesting take on a space movie - being not really a space movie. Plot holes were wayyy too obvious and the flash forwards although good attempts at making the storyline believable, still weren't. Using more logic in the writing/making of this movie would have done wonders. Guessing this was done on a small budget and it did well using that. Some legit scenes which were emotional and moving.
