This film may have a few name action stars such as Vinnie Jones, Tom Sizemore and Bai Ling, but it is a home made film written and directed by a nobody wannabe named Nadeem Soumah. The action is non existent and the murder for hire scenario(s) is about as dull as a plastic knife attempting to cut through concrete.Vinnie Jones narrates the background story going back in time at 2 week intervals. If you have watched Vinnie Jones in the two prior Guy Ritchie writer/director films, the 1998 Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels , and the 2000 film Snatch then you know what a good film looks like. I think the writer/director of 6 Ways to Die, Nadeem Soumah, may have used a ghost writer to write this MESSterpiece which he thought in his own mind would be an award winning film NOT!!!!!!Avoid it because the film is a mess.
