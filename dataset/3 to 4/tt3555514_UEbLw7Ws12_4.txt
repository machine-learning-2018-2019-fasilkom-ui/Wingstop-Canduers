Luke Perry stops to help a stranded motorist on New Year's Eve and they get to
talking about how back in his youth when his role is played by Alex Shaffer he
goes out in search of his birth mother reputed to hang around a 24 hour diner
called The Griddle House.When there Shaffer meets some interesting, interacts with some drama with
other people there as the clock ticks the year away.Nothing really more to say. William Saroyan's great play The Time Of Your
Life seems to have been the inspiration for this film. But in execution it falls
woefully short.An interesting try though.
