I have actually never rated a horror movie lower than 5 on here due to the infallible rating system that IMDb relies on. However, in this case I could not actually sit still to watch this movie.As an avid lover of horror movies, I believe that the "Hollywood" part of the genre has taken what the indie type films have managed to salvage. Rarely, has Hollywood taken a premise and made it better; unfortunately, for this film this is one of those rare occasions.Encounter starts off with the usual trope of newlywed couple, dedicated spouse (usually groom) to filming or capturing some paranormal activity, a dedicated, but skeptical spouse and some sort of paranormal entity. As the movie progresses, it's likening to Paranormal Activity becomes very obvious (even with the found footage type of film).What makes the film unwatchable, to me, is the lack of depth in character development. The landlord is creepy and weird enough and while he has some spotlight, not enough information went into his development. The couple becomes annoying after the first half and the plot takes waaaaaaaaaaay too long to progress. The movie is less than 90 minutes, but it could be completed in 50 and would've been a far better project.Recommendation: watch on Netflix or some other movie website but don't pay for this. Prepare your patience in advance and don't get your hopes up. Good Luck!
