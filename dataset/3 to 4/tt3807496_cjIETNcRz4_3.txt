The director, writer and producer of this movie, Peter Pardini, is the nephew of Chicago's current keyboard player, Lou Pardini. The bias and defensiveness of the remaining (and less talented) band members is transparent from the first few minutes of the film (e.g., in opening lines like, "we are all replaceable."). Most big name bands have their arrogant member or two but usually it's the lead singer -- not the case here. I'm unsure why CNN is involved in this flick. There's obviously a good story and some good material here, but rock docs like VH1 Behind the Scenes were more balanced and entertaining and usually left you wanting more. The first half of this doc is good, but after the band is turned into a shadow of itself, and studio guns take over some positions (drums), the story starts to feel like the current band -- just not that interesting but still full of itself.
