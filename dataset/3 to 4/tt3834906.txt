Today I've also watched Nightbeasts (2010) so I'm certainly having a yeti themed day.Trouble is as much as I have nothing against this sub-genre they very rarely manage to entertain. I'm not quite sure why, but perhaps because they're all essentially the same.In its defence The Curse Of Blood Mountain does try to be different and on top of our big footed friends we also have zombies and a supernatural element but it doesn't work in its favour.This hyper low budget effort at time of writing only has 16 people rated it so it couldn't be much more obscure. To its credit it actually looks great and the cast exceeded my expectations.Sadly the film itself isn't great and doesn't really make all that much sense. Credit where credit is due, they tried and it shows but this really isn't great.The Good: Cast are far better than you'd expect for such a microbudget movie Looks great The Bad: Story is a mess Weak finale Amateurish coverThings I Learnt From This Movie: Adding zombies to a sasquatch movie isn't as good as it sounds
