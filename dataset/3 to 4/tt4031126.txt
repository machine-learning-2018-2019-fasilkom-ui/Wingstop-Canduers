I'm not really sure where to start with this one. I'm not even sure if the filmmakers even knew what they were making as it comes out as a werewolf movie that follows traditional slasher formula, which doesn't work.Some teens go into a forest, one of them (and it's real obvious who) has a claw thing, then at some point some of them die in confusing fashion. In between everything is bad: acting, effects, dialogue, editing, directing, even the music choices seem off.Overall this movie is nearly unwatchable, there are constraints that come with a low budget but you can still write good lines and have them delivered well and produce some type of movie. Here there is no attempt to do any of that and it just seems like a one-take affair where everything was cobbled together and thrown out there despite the apparent bad quality. It's just not worth the time.
