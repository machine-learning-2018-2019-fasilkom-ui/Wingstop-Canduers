I don't claim to be an authority on horses, but what little I do know kind of downplays any enthusiasm for this film.Adolescent Sarah Bolen is sent to live in rural Michigan with her father Kevin Sorbo for the summer and she's not seen much of him over the years so she's disappointed. Her mother keeps her in a lifestyle that's extravagant for them, she has a show horse that she's training for competition. Sorbo's farm out there might be a good training ground for her and the horse.But she develops an enthusiasm for rodeo when she arrives no doubt fueled by a young rodeo cowboy Derek Brandon who works for Sorbo. I won't say any more.But for the life of me I can't see how a horse bred for shows could be turned into a horse used for barrel racing in a rodeo. Just not done and I think the film will be justly criticized for it. Like trying to train a thoroughbred race horse all of a sudden into a horse for harness racing. The smartest of horses, Mr. Ed in fact just wouldn't take to it though Mr. Ed could articulate why from his point of view.Nice family film otherwise, but the horse changing his training is too big to overlook.
