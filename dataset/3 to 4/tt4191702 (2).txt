The movie "Norman" I would award 3 3/4 stars out of 5. Most of the movie was slow and repetitious. Norman's various meetings - especially the cameo ones-- could have been presented in a shorter version. What saved the movie, was the "4th Act", which was brilliant. I also thought the facial close-ups were overdone. As good as Gir was, I tired of this aspect, almost but not quite mugging. Of course the Israeli viewer can "enjoy" certain parallels to political corruption occurrences in the past- and maybe hints at the present "difficulties" of the present Prime Minister. If the movie had been shorter, it would have been better. It did mix nice satiric aspects with drama.
