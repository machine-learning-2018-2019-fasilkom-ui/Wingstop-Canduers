This movie was dull as dirt. Tremendous actors doing a fine job, but why. I suffered through to the end while enduring the criticism of those around me that gave up. Each time they walked through they'd ask what I was asking myself, "why are you still watching this?"This movie has no redeeming human interest story either.
