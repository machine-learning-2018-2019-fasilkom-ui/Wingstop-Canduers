My quick rating - 3,6/10. Strange to rate this as a fictional movie, the whole thing is basically "how to shoot cameras from in the car, outside the car, near the car." This is all done to show new film makers the proper way to highlight the scenery, characters, etc. Did this movie intend to be anything but a flick showing how to film? Sort of, there was an occasional reference to a tow truck driver chasing after the two dumb girls in the car (I only call them dumb because of how they act in the movie. Would love to see them rolling their eyes when they read the script). I will say that this movie is very odd indeed since it could appeal to fans of "joy ride" and also could get notice from the school of film making wherever these kids were from, but combined together makes for a really boring movie.
