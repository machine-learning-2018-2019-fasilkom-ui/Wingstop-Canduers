Nice clown. Stupid and pointless story. At one point it became boring just about killing one, killing another. It started off in a way it actually made me curious about it.. then boo. Your usual psychopath with no background story that goes on a killing spree precisely on Halloween night. 
I did like the killings though. Lol it's for the sake of blood and gore that I'm rating this 3.
