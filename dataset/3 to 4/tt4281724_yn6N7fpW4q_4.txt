The overrated "Terrifier" is a horror film with a promising and funny beginning, with the alcoholic Dawn acting like a stupid and the clown accepting the silliness. Until the moment Tara and Dawn are abducted, the film works reasonably well. However, when Victoria drives to give a ride to her sister and Dawn, she hears that there is a serial killer in the area. But even being aware of the dangerous situation, she begins to take a series of very stupid e clichés attitudes culminating in the awful conclusion. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): Not Available
