The scariest thing about this movie is that people actually edited it and thought it was fit for the human public. A horror movie does not have to have a huge budget but I would think that when it comes to the actors the purse strings shouldn't be so tight. Where in tarnation did they get the Madison character? My cat could have put on a better performance. For most of the movie she did this awful sobbing voice whine for about 85% of the movie. Someone mentioned her awful portrayal of a limp and they were spot on, it was like she thought she was doing improv or something. I cant believe her bio states that she went to a performing arts school? The dog in the movie was more convincing than her. The script only made matters worse. Was the writer under character limits? Many lines in the movie were repeated several times in many scenes, I had the captions on so I literally could see that the script was full of the actors repeating themselves and with the same awful intonations each time. The plot is so stupid and could have been forgiven id the movie had hired writers and real actors instead of their neighbors.I am very much upset I picked this out to watch on my night off. tsk tsk,
