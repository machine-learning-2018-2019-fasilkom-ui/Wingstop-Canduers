Well, the premise is very interesting and makes you think about many possibilities regarding the "lost boy" character.To be honest with you, I only watched it for morbid curiosity; I mean, I expected the "lost boy" to terrorize the family in unlike ways, not in the likes of "Saw", but, situations like in "The Hand that Rocks the Craddle" (1992). However, the situations are very lame and soon you lose empathy towards the main character.The script is very weak and never fully explains the origin of the lost boy or who really "took him" when he was an infant. Virginia Madsen is fantastic as always and her portrayal of a mother that cannot cope with the lose of a son but keeps the hope for many years is perfect. Watch it only if it airs at 2:00 a.m.
