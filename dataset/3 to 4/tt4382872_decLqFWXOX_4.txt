Extraction (2015) is probably the worst film of this genre put out in the year 2015 that featured a well respected actor. I'm quite stunned to see that out of so many producers on this project that it looks as if not one of them done anything to make the film worth watching.Extraction is a film which is riding the coattails of Bruce Willis, knowing that with his name on the picture a lot of people would go check it out. I've always been a fan of Bruce Willis and what I saw in this movie truly upset me to see, the film is horrible. The movie has hardly any script or direction, the acting from 90% of the actors is at TV Commercial level; what were they thinking? I was really hoping this film would've at least been entertaining to some level.
