In New York, the cashier of a restaurant Katie (Dominik García-Lorido) is a traumatized woman since she was raped and got an abortion some time ago. Katie is under therapy and uses pills to keep stable and her best friend is Debbie (Ninja N. Devoe) that works with her. When she meets the handsome movie star Jay (Brock Kelly) in the restaurant, they have a love affair and Jay invites Katie to move to his apartment in Los Angeles. She meets Father Bill (Raymond J. Barry) on the arrival and stays with Jay a couple of days. But he needs to shoot a film and leaves Katie alone in the apartment. Soon strange things happen driving Katie to question her sanity."Desolation" is a horror film (or thriller) that has attractive moments, beginning with the gorgeous Dominik García-Lorido (maybe the greatest attraction of this film). The promising beginning holds the attention of the viewer, but soon the plots becomes predictable. However the deceptive flawed conclusion has so many holes that makes "Desolation" a terrible film, losing the initial potentiality of the story. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): Not Available
