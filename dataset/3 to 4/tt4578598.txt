This is a very confusing movie. There are a lot of questions you don't get answers to until the end and still some left open. All the men in this movie have a sleazy vibe to them. The mother seems to maybe have some mental issues and a problem with her youngest son. There are flashbacks, day dreams/hallucinations and you are not sure which is which. Through the whole movie you are left wondering what is going on and start thinking maybe your blue ray skipped a scene. Reminds me a bit of the movie "Mother!"
