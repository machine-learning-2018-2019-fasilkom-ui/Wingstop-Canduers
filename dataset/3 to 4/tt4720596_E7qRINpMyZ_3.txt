Zach Avery's acting was like a cancer to this movie. Every time he was on screen it died a little more. Good god, how did he make it past the auditions?Lyndsy Fonseca did a fine job with the sub-par lines and direction, so it may have been an fun, but throw-away average movie if it wasn't for Zach Screen Cancer Avery who did his best version of Lenny von Dohlen's "Miles" from Electric Dreams (circa 1984). It's so bad, in fact, that it has prompted this, my first IMDB review. Avoid.
