Well that is the long journey over with, after binge watching all 16 Witchcraft movies I can confidently say it IS the worst franchise in film history.Witchcraft 16 (Can you believe it?!) does to its credit take a very interesting turn and is set in a world where all the Witchcraft films were exactly that. It revolves around the remaining cast members and how they are preparing for the next movie. But of course Witchcraft has to come into it somewhere and the movie uses its constant recasting as a plot point.I'm ashamed to say it, but I thought that was really clever and the smartest thing they've done in 16 movies.Sadly the film itself though better than most of them is still dreadful. The same lousy effects, the same cheesy acting and the same poor writing.16 may well be the best movie in the franchise but it still gave me a headache.Will we see Witchcraft 17? For the sake of my mental health I hope not.The Good:Follows directly on from part 15Berna Roberts &amp; Noël VanBrocklinSome weirdly good ideasThe Bad:Cringe inducingAll the usual problemsThings I Learnt From This Movie:1 good idea per 16 movies is an impressive feat
