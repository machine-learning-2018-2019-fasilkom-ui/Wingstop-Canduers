This movie was sold to me as a movie that will change my life... This made absolutely no sense at all. First of all. If the deads want the girl estrella to help them why they try to hurt her. And i dont even know where to start anymore there are so many useless things in this movie. I think it would actually have been better thriller movie without the fantastic and horror part.
It feels like they just put a lot of visual fantastic effects just to make it look so profound and deep meaning.
