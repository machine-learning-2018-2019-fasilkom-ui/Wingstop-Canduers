Unless you want to go drown yourself after viewing this. It started out with promise, thought it was going to be a somewhat decent Lifetime movie which would've been better than this. This movie is listed as a Thriller, but it should've been a dark comedy. It was awful, too awful to spoil, that it will do on it's own.
