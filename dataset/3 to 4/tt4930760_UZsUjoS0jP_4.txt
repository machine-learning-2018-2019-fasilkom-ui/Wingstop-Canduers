This film popped up on Netflix and I've been starving for a decent exorcism film lately. I checked IMDb and it had a rating of 6.0/10 (209 votes) which isn't bad for an obscure foreign horror flick and it had yet-to-be reviewed by critics or users, so I was hoping to be the first to write a glowing review. Unfortunately this is yet another bog-standard entry in the demonic possession genre. Considering that it's clearly a relatively low budget independent film, the production values aren't too shabby. Sadly the acting, the effects and the dialogue fluctuate between good and bad. I noticed a lot of grammatical errors in the subtitles. You expect that sort of thing when you're watching a dodgy pirate copy but obviously you expect more from an official Netflix release. The demons are like watered-down Deadites from The Evil Dead. They display all the usual demonic clichés such as body contortions, sticking their tongues out and asking priests to f*** them :pThere were a couple of twists but they were nothing we haven't seen before or couldn't smell coming from a mile away. I thoroughly enjoyed The Last Exorcism even though the ending was a bit crap and the sequel was a lot crap. The last decent exorcism flick I saw was The Devil Inside over 5 years ago. I'm aware that it has a low IMDb rating and the reviews are wildly mixed but I consider it to be a 9/10. The ending was lacklustre but it left me hoping for a sequel. You may wanna consider watching or re-watching The Devil Inside before giving Diary Of An Exorcist a go... unless you're Portuguese :DCheck out my IMDb list for potentially better suggestions http://www.imdb.com/list/ls008092160/
