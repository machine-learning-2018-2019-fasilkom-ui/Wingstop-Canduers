There are worse films out there.When that's how your review starts, it probably is bad news.I don't have a ton good to say about the film. The acting is stunted; I constantly felt like the leads were going to break into laughter because they just didn't believe in what they were doing.The overall topic and scenario were not terrible. The message walked a fine line of being informative, preachy, or critical.The title probably doesn't deserve the (high) rating it's getting, it deserves a solid 3 or 4. I give it a 4 just because I did enjoy watching it even though the acting was cringy.
