Just got finish watching this movie and I found it very interesting. I have to say I am surprised that Annelie Tipton it's such a good actress. I first knew her from America's next top model. I think Alex was taking her to that Castle to see if she could relieve herself of some of the pain she had been caring around due to their relationship. There was a lot I didn't understand, granted, but I will look into it a little bit more to see if I can't get more of the plot.
