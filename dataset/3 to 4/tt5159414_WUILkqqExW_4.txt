In LA, a group of friends has gathered to celebrate Tyler's birthday. His girlfriend Christen Wills has six tickets to an escape room.These are the unappealing beautiful people. Their dialogue is boring. They are boring. The movie spends 20 minutes at a boring unnecessary dinner party. The first half is nothing but boring. It's not until somebody dies that the escape room gets a little tense. It just takes too long to kill somebody. The only actor I remember from something else is Elisabeth Hower and she's stuck in a cage for most of this even if she's naked. These characters are nothing. This might work if it gets to the killing faster. The ending could have gotten a final twist but it even does that wrong. The escape room is fun for about 15 minutes but that's it for this movie.
