Sarasota Keys featuring Jack Dowd is a misleading and inappropriate title. Sarasota Keys was not designed to feature any one person in particular. Rather the stars of Sarasota Keys are the people that engage in the spontaneity of making music with an artful upright piano in downtown Sarasota. Imagine the surprise on people's faces when they see a tastefully painted piano on a street corner! Then they get the impulse to sit down and explore their memories for spectators to enjoy. See the numerous clips at the Arts Alliance website.Jack Dowd 27, would be a better title for the film. Jack's piano was very well done, like many of the other artists who participated in Sarasota Keys. Thanks to these great artists! They were credited at the end of the film as we saw about a 1 minute glimpse of their work in an introductory 6 piano concert. This might have been a great starting point for the film!? Then step back and show how we got there.The rest of the content of the film I found weak. We have to remember that in this installation a piano is designed to also be played making it a multi dimensional art work. It would have been interesting to hear the great 27 performed in tribute on the instrument? I did not understand Jack's cameo singing with guitar (under the premise of Sarasota Keys). Nor the long moments of trying to decide what color to paint the piano and the endless goodbye of the piano leaving Jack's studio in a white truck. Did I hear Jack say he was tired looking at it? Kudos to Larry Keckler who resurrected 27 after it was drenched and nearly destroyed in several rainstorms at Mattisons. That was a miracle. I hope to see the piano on the street again in a safer environment where everyone from the homeless to children to the concert pianist will enjoy. Thanks Jack, for providing that to our community!
