If you have a weakness for checking out cheap---really cheap---"monster thrillers", you may find a few things to like about this. Yes, the plot is requisitely stupid, the script's laden with your usual moronic dialogue, and characters are dispatched in standard fashion. But the photography isn't bad and several of the cast members have talent--something not often seen in movies about giant bloodthirsty roosters and such. Unfortunately, they're saddled with the usual "who's going to get it next" plot because--as you're no doubt aware--psychotic rooster-men are not satisfied with simply scaring people. Those of you who have nothing better to do may want to see how the hero deals with these ware-fowl at the end. Just give your sense of logic a siesta and pop some corn.
