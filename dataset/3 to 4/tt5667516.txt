After a bar fight results in a fatality, an American soldier named "Jake" (Cam Gigandet) is sent to a top secret prison where only those with classified information are imprisoned. As it so happens, however, this prison also contains drones and missiles used to hit terrorist targets elsewhere in the world. Not only that, but a nuclear warhead is also kept there as well. That being the case it is an extremely tempting target for an Afghan warlord named "General Khan" (Arash Mokhtar) whose family was killed by the Americans-and he wants vengeance. To that end he hires a mercenary by the name of "Colonel Irving" (Michael Dale) who proceeds to hire a crack team in order to take the secret base by force. What he doesn't count on are the prisoners who have managed to obtain their release in all of the confusion and are equally intent on stopping them from getting their hands on a nuclear weapon. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film had potential but suffered from a lack of imagination, bad acting, poorly written script and an extremely predictable plot. That being said, I have rated it accordingly. Below average.
