While this was rather an enjoyable little 'trip', this adventure mystery romp, the ending ruined it by not giving proper closure to the story.
Like being told a joke or asked a riddle and then not being given the punchline, it leaves an unsatisfied taste in the mouth.
This seems to be happening more and more these days in films, is it a lack of talent in storytelling , a pretentious trend or just plain laziness masquerading as 'art'.
Either way it's bloody annoying.
