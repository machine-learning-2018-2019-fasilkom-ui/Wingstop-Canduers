Why? This is utter disappointment on a base of such a hype. Poor dialogues and the lengthy plot make this piece a torture for the audience. It carries a social message in a clear way (commercialized and attempted to entertain), well thanks for it. Had it been a short-film with such a cast and a compact story line, I would have really enjoyed it.
