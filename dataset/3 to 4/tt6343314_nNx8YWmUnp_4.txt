I really enjoyed the first film, but this one is so predictable and derivative, they've clearly run out of ideas.The training and fight sequences (which make a Rocky movie a Rocky movie) only make up a short percentage of the running time.
In between those sequences is where this really suffers - "Mr and Mrs Creed" are no Rocky and Adrian.The fights are decent enough but it's all too predictable.
Time to let this franchise die with dignity.
