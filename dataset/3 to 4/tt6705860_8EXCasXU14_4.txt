Considering its subject, Diane should've taken sweeter time with its acting, but quite unfortunately, it didn't. The story is quite good and the cinematography is beautiful (until 60% of the film becomes phantom rides of cars driving), but the acting is simply not that good. It's fine when the characters are just talking, but whenever they yell or get passionate, it's simply laughable. Jake Lacy is painfully miscast as Brian, delivering a performance so unconvincing and cringeworthy that it could be mistaken for an SNL sketch. Mary Kay Place starts out okay in the title role, but when she delivers emotional moments, she stumbles and comes across little more than a testy grandma.D+
