This movie is not funny at all nor entertaining. Adam Sandler has made some really bad movies in recent years, Sandler tops last year's disaster Sandy Wexler and makes something even unfunnier "The Week Of". Usually a movie has 15 or 20 minutes at its best to make you care for the film and follow the story, but this movie does not accomplish that. I am a fan of some of Adam Sandler works and Chris Rock's stand-ups, but it is so upsetting and annoying that Sandler knows that he could write some basic story with really cringe-worthy and cheap jokes and makes a sh** ton of money, so he doesn't even try to make something good. Why do it when you can make money with something really bad. I don't think i will be following any next movies of Sandler's unless he did not write the script or had any creative connections to the production process. (Like his upcoming film with Safdie brothers, i will be checking that out)
I definitely do not recommend this movie to you, It has nothing to offer. Don't waste any time on it
