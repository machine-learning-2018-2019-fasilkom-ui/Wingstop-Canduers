A fairly basic story that has been explored in other films, unfortunately weighted down by an unsubtle political message poorly communicated.The acting is good, the production values high and dialogue well delivered despite the bland script. I feel the actors really working hard to make the film gel, which makes it more the pity that it doesn't. After an hour of gratuitous torture I felt like the person in the box.The experience wasn't going well and this gave me too much time to ask myself where this film was going? It was going nowhere...This one is going to sink without trace having failed in its social message. What one is left with is an over articulated cerebral video nasty.
