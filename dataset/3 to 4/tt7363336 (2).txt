I give this supremely disappointing effort four stars only, one for each of the beautiful, talented, bright and shining ladies this exercise in boredom is purportedly about. But no stars for anything else.How anyone could spend two days with these four women and come out with a film that has about 10 interesting minutes if that, no insights, no revelations, waaay too many clips of their old performances that are not what any of us are there to see, and precious little humor is beyond me. Every time an interesting topic of conversation is begun, it ends abruptly.I wish someone else had been in charge of those two days. These glorious ladies deserved better.
