That would have been a more accurate title for this disappointing film. There's way too much talk about how these women related to Olivier than there is about the stellar lives and careers of these four beautiful women. I'm sure each of their lives doesn't need the backdrop of a man to be supremely interesting. This film needs way more than the enervating conversation we get.
