A parent dealing with their child and substance abuse, but Roberts and Lucas were the only two that were needed to make this story work. As a former cocaine user (thirty years clean now thank God) The story was OK. Nothing to write home about because I've seen much better films on the topic of drug addiction and substance abuse. I myself am a living witness on how drugs destroy lives and breaks a mother's heart. Overall a decent watch.
