This film caught my eye having lived in a community adjacent to Mansfield and also having gotten caught up in other series like "Making a Murderer," that for me were fascinating exposés of our legal system. This film is not in that category, but more of a trip down memory lane for the young boy, Collier, 20+ years after his mother was murdered.I stopped watching about 30 minutes into the documentary because it failed to indicate there were any curious aspects of the actual crime or legal trial. Rather the focus was on Collier both as a 12 year old when his mother was murdered (through video testimony at trial) and as an adult trying to reconnect with various adults involved in his and his mothers social sphere before and after the murder.The only aspect that I found remotely interesting was that 12 year old Collier was unusually very adult like as a 12 year old, possibly due to his somewhat unique relationship with his mother and what were clearly unusual circumstances growing up in that household. That said, it was not enough to hold my interest and I didn't get the sense there would be any surprising developments as the story progressed, so I felt no compulsion to go further.
