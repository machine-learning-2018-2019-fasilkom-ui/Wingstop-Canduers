Which, of course, is not saying anything much. The voice work is bad, the characters are ugly, and there's a lot of stolen assets; the antagonist is just Pip from Barnyarn cosplaying as Darth Vader.That said, the creators have taken a step in the right direction by taking on a more ambitious project. By telling a story instead of going with the 'instant dance party' format they've been doing, there's actual writing and a narrative to follow. Not all that engaging of one, of course, but it got a few genuine laughs from me.
