I am blind fan of SRLS. The movie is so badly executed that I had to wake up, remove my blindfold, and post negative comments to a SRLS movie. Story is inspired from hit bollywood movies. So you cannot blame the story. Actors and actresses have done their part. Portions covered by Saruk is noteworthy. But the execution of movie as a whole is total disaster. There are no proper background mood sounds, I never knew they are so important until I watched this movie. Actor recalls scenes while telling his recent past to his dad, there are no transition effects and viewers are left at their mercy to figure that out by themselves. Actor and actress falls in love, cannot see chemistry. Don't producers and editors show movie to few people before releasing in theaters? It should be evident to every single person that there are technical glitches. As far as I can tell, all the viewers felt and thought the same thing. I could hear few satirical ridiculing laughs and saw some leave the theater commenting - "kasto jhuur movie parecha". And there are 19 votes giving 10/10. I guess we all know who they are.
