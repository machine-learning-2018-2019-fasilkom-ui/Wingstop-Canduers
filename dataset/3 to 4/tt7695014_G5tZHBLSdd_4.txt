I was expecting SBG3 to be a complete turd, and only went because a friend insisted on us seeing it. There are occasionally interesting moments, mainly because of the returning actors - Jimmy Shergill and Mahie Gill - who are comfortable in their roles even if by now the characters have become cardboard conspirators instead of the more nuanced personas of the first film. These are mixed with heaped helpings of non-sequitur and unintentional hilarity. Sanjay Dutt looks like age, plus a lifetime of booze and hedonistic living have addled his brain to the point he has a perennial slur (or perhaps he was drunk throughout the shoot). Chitrangada Singh is seen as a second-fiddle nautch girl character whose accent suggests she studied her mujra craft at Cambridge, or perhaps Yale. Other characters come and go with less-than-basic regard to continuity and coherence, like no one thought to do a second draft on the script or perhaps even wrote it up as they shot on set.Apart from the leads, the film's casting seems to have been decided based on a "Kahan gaye woh log?" Bollywood trivia quiz so you have appearances from Kabir Bedi, Nafisa Ali and Deepak-fricking-Tijori.
