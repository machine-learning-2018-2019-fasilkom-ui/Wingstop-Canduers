Worst movie from Allu Arjun. Didn't expect a movie like this.
Firstly, this movie is highly mismarketed on purpose. I'm pretty sure that producers watched the movie and thought the movie was garbage, so they used people's weakness: soldier fighting at the border. So they promoted it this way instead of promoting that the movie is about land mafia and how an off duty soldier saved a family from it. Positives:
Arjun Sarja. Plotline. Allu Arjun's danceNegatives:
Why Herione?
Allu Arjun worst acting, trying to imitate Arjun reddy. 
Why is there a mother character?
Waste of too many good actors.
How Allu Arjun wins a fight against Thakur Singh?
and many more.Don't watch this movie. Most reviews here are totally made by hardcore fans. 
Allu Arjun dissapointed me with a useless movie again. Hopefully next one is better.
