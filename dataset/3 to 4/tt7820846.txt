When you have Salman Khan backing you up, the world is at your feet. However, you should take benefit of this privilege. Unfortunately, director Abhiraj Maniwala makes sure that this journey is forgettable for you.LoveYatri tells the story of local Garba teacher, Sushrut, who falls in with a NRI girl, Manisha, hailing from London. Due to misunderstanding, she travels back to London while Sushrut must try to win her back.First time director, Abhiraj Minawala, tells the story which we have witnessed innumerable times on the silver screen. Even if the treatment of the subject would have been sober, I would have been happy to write the review. Unfortunately, the film is a big boredom right from the beginning till the end. With high production values, the makers forgot to focus on the most important part of the film - script. Cinematography is beautiful while art direction is superb along with good background score. Music by Sanchit Balhara is the only saving grace in the film. "Chagoda" is probably one of the best song of the year. Performances by the new kids on the block - Aayush Sharma and Warina Hussain is weak and both actors are expressionless throughout the film. Ronit Roy is repeating himself in the same role again and again. It is Ram Kapoor who shines with his fantastic performance.Overall, LoveYatri is a journey full of loopholes. Terrible 1/5
