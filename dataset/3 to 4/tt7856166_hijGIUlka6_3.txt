Total disappointment. Had very high expectations. The movie starts with a 'War of Egos" between the upper class families. There was no need to add unwanted fight sequences and make it a spoiler. Script was done well, but pretty bad execution. 
Nothing new or different- the message was delivered only in the last 5 mins- else you would understand where is the movie heading towards. 'Message to the Society'- Open your heart and speak up. Don't let ego come between you &amp; your loved ones'.
