This is an MGM promotional short showing the leading actors, MARLON BRANDO and GLENN FORD arriving at the airport in Japan where they are greeted by a number of Japanese before departing for the filming location where MGM has built a small village on 11 acres of land.The narrator says something about "the scenic beauty of Old Japan" but the concentration remains on the construction of the teahouse setting. We're told that Brando has worked for several months on his accent and we see him in make-up for the role. EDDIE ALBERT and HARRY MORGAN are seen relaxing between scenes, as well as a couple of the Japanese actresses who are being made up for their roles as Geisha girls.For this meeting of east and west cultures, we're told that 12 bilingual translators were necessary for production to flow smoothly.
