Lionel Barrymore sits behind a desk and hosts this review of MGM's 25 years of film-making leadership. After a small bit of braggadocio, he introduces a great film from each year, from John Gilbert &amp; Greta Garbo silents through Academy Award winning Best Pictures like Broadway Melody, Mutiny on the Bounty, and Mrs. Miniver. He then introduces some clips from several films in production to be released that year like The Stratton Story, The Secret Garden, and Take Me Out to the Ball Game before mentioning a few others (e.g. On the Town) without showing any footage. The short ends with some familiar panning shots, for anyone who watches TCM, from the studio's Silver Jubilee banquet that features "more stars than there are in Heaven" (actors from Robert Taylor to Ava Gardner etc.).
