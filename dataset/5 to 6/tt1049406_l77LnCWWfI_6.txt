Dude clearly had a giant impact and i think he at least deserved to get his sauna. I know that the movie is a means to that as well as a chronicle and testament to the man's work and life. I really am happy to see artists and designers getting documentaries made with their input and charisma on screen. So far he is the youngest of the few I've seen and that says something since he's like 72 in the picture. Video documentaries make these people so much more accessible to the youth and uncouth and really do a great service for everyone's benefit. I mean, how many people even realize that opening credits are something people get paid for?
