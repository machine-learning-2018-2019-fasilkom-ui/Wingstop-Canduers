Hmm...not sure about this one.The film was very well written, it was engaging, the actors were impressive and there was genuine emotional involvement.But after watching it, instead of thinking "what a good film", all I could think was "what was the point of that?" And I'm not even someone who thinks films have to have deep and meaningful things to say but even Transformers has a point (save the world etc.) There is literally no reason for this film unless I missed something. Is there a message about being good? about rehabilitation? loneliness? what?! I don't know and I don't think I can recommend people watch a film that is so pointless.I would give the film a 5 for "overall" enjoyment and at least 7 for the overall great execution of the film so I will rate it a 6.Watch it if you are a fan of any of the actors because you won't be bored but don't be surprised when you feel strangely disappointed after watching.
