Frank (Michael Shannon) is a mercurial chef in Las Vegas. He has a passionate romance with mysterious budding fashion designer Lola (Imogen Poots). She reveals that her mother's former boyfriend Alan Larsson (Michael Nyqvist) had raped her. Her new boss Keith Winkleman (Justin Long) gets Frank an audition for a famous chef in France. After the audition, Frank heads for Paris to confront Alan.The start is a bit muddled and disjointed. Frank and Lola need a good meet cute. Shannon is great at the brooding dark role. Despite the age difference, Poots projects a damaged soul who is attracted to Shannon's powerful darkness. I do question the confrontation with Alan. I can't believe that Alan would invite a perfect stranger into his love nest unless he's looking for a homoerotic one-night stand. I would increase the tension by having Frank kidnap him ending up at Alan's pad. The entire movie is a little disjointed but I do appreciate the noirish style. It could have been executed better.
