I think that this was well put together but it was not at all what i expected. A lot more singing and the story line could have been explored a bit more. It is sad when my wife who is not an avid movie goer is able to answer all the questions that should be discovered over the entirety of the movie.Plus:Great music and top notch singers and performers.Introduction to new artist coming on the scene.Negative:Movie never develops a rich story line in my opinion and some of the scenes were hard to follow. overall:Great movie for fellow music lovers it was like watching a long music video.
