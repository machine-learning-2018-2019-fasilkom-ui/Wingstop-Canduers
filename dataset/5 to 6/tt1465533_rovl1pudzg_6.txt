I'm not quite with the person who described this film as a crime (although he writes a good review); but this film certainly didn't deliver what it promised in the opening act.I'm a big fan of Selma Blair, and she does her best with the material given. Unfortunately, what starts out as an atmospheric thriller soon degenerates into an implausible hook (oddly enough, less interesting than if they'd just continued the original storyline), with a horribly pat ending, complete with cops discovering a cellphone ringing at a grave, that has "10 minutes to wrap" written all over it.All of which is a great pity, because it had a good cast, and there was some decent acting on display before it all goes west.So: not a crime, but certainly not all it could have been. For a much better movie with a similar theme, see 'Copycat'.6/10
