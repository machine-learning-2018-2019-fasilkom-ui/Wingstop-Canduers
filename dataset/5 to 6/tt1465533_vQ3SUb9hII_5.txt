I agree with another reviewer who compared this to a Good Hitchcock Movie; found it to be suspenseful enough to keep me interested in wanting to know more.Maybe I'm not as sophisticated as some movie critics, but to me even mediocre actors can carry a Story, and hold my attention; IMO all the Actors did their 'job' and got the Story told. The 90 or so minutes helps also; so if you can sit through movies on TV or Cable, then you will not be disappointed sitting through this one.Would I pay to see this, or watch it again? No, but I would recommend it to anybody who watches TV drams.Want to add that I use IMDb for every Movie I am interested in, and think the service provided by IMDb is extremely helpful.
