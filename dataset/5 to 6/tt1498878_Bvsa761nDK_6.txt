This one came as a mighty pleasant surprise. It's a B-movie, make no mistake, with cheap SFX and wooden acting but it's superbly charming in its comic-book fake seriousness. , The faithful reconstruction of pre-WWII university &amp; rural life and the obvious and unwavering love of Master HPL's work are commendable, as is the protagonist's astounding performance - he goes through the entire film with a despondent, "Why Me" expression on his face. B&amp;W certainly helps, making the movie stylized, at times almost dreamy and otherworldly -to borrow Master HPL's beloved word. An entertaining flic? You bet.
