Although the first 45 minutes of Soda Springs is rather slow and uninspiring lead actor Jay Pickett plays a handsome wild and reckless skirt chaser named Eden Jackson who ends up in prison for causing a senior couples death(s) while driving drunk. But hang in there for the latter half of the film because eventually Eden gets his ($)hit together and he returns home to his mother's farm where she welcomes him with open arms. Unfortunately the townspeople who are fully aware of Eden's reckless behavior are not very happy with his presence and he is treated as if he was the town pariah.Most unhappy to see Jay Pickett back in town is the local owner of the car dealership named Larry (Michael Bowen) who has married Jay's ex-wife Pam (Miranda Frigon) and they have a son who they are raising.There are secrets that come to light and if you hang in there for the last 30 minutes of the film it is worth waiting for. It was an unexpected ending and not what I expected at all. Jay Pickett's redemption is about to come full circle in Soda Springs.I give the film a decent 6 out of 10 rating - the ending is worth hanging in there for.
