"Lock up your wives and daughters, Eden Jackson's back in town." Eight years after a terrible accident affected a small Idaho town the man responsible returns to start his life over. Almost instantly the town begins to treat him as an outcast and refuses to accept him back to the community. Slowly he begins to win his ex over and secrets start to come out that change the town forever. I have seen a few movies like this (I can't remember the names of them) but it has the feel of a movie like "Pure Country". An exiled resident returns to face his past and meets resistance. You have all seen that movie before so you won't be surprised. This movie is pretty cheesy but it is actually not bad and does have a twist at the end that isn't totally predictable but not unexpected. Without trying to spoil the movie I will let you know that Tom Skerritt is in the movie for about 2 minutes, so if that's why your renting it be warned. Overall, not really a whole lot to say about this movie. Cheesy but an OK movie that many will like. I give it a B.
