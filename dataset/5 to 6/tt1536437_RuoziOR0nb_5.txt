As the owner of a Ford Ranchero, I always get excited whenever I see a Ford Ranchero in a movie, therefore, I got all excited when the blue 1973 Ford Ranchero first showed up in this movie. In real life, Ford Ranchero owners do not appreciate their vehicles being called an El Camino. Not that we have anything against the Chevrolet El Camino, we just feel that people need to know better, especially if you have one in a movie. The '73 Ranchero in this movie repeatedly gets called a '67 El Camino. That really upset me, especially since it was the most talked about vehicle in the movie. Anybody's defense cannot be that it looks like an El Camino, because El Caminos look like Ranchero. The Ranchero was introduced in 1957 whereas the El Camino wasn't made until 1959. I understand that the story doesn't really have anything to do with cars, but they need to get these simple facts straight.
