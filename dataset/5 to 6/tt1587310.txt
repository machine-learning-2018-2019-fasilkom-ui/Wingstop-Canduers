I found it very frustratingly uneven. Visually the location and production design was fascinating, but the special effects were mostly fake and didn't blend to the performances which were mostly just standing by with nothing the do and the flying scenes with the fairies looked too fake like an old video game sequence. Angelina wasn't that menacing in Maleficent. She played it very hammy where she was over emphasizing the lines and didn't seem that mean. The story is just as uneven since it wants to be both a retelling of Sleeping Beauty and a brand new story about Maleficent so the main character is both Maleficent and Princess Aurora. They also changed some of the story and it made me not sure if certain parts were supposed to be funny or serious and Maleficent as a character was just as unfocused emotionally. Why couldn't they just retell Sleeping Beauty or tell a prequel of Maleficent instead of combining the two? My mind was feeling like I was watching two movies fused together!
