I think this movie may have originally been meant to be a play but it adapts well. I enjoyed it much more than most independent movies. I do not find anything cliché about it. There are several duos of characters present who are each coming to terms with what they know of particular relationships in their lives or what they think they know of those relationships. I think the acting ability in this is fair. There are several new faces to see but they each demonstrate a proficient ability. There are some very to scenes to put this in the quirky category which I like. I enjoyed this film.I think it is definitely worth a watch.
