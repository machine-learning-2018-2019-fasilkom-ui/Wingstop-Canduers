Is probably ten or twenty million dollars. Meaning, better production values, better direction, script doctors, etc.Rom coms are one tough genre for gay folk, evidently. There aren't many that succeed. This one doesn't either, but I can see how the script--which is pretty innocuous--almost makes it over the finish line. There are at least a couple of sharp lines in the movie, all delivered by the hardworking Jennifer Elise Cox.I've come to the conclusion that it's a matter of money. There are plenty of straight rom coms that are much more watchable than this movie, but they aren't really any better. Throw a lot of money at a mediocre script and at least it's viewable. Is it really that simple?This premise could have been sharp and original. But the writer and the director went for the obvious to make up for what the script lacked. And the result is overwrought and overacted and unnecessarily frantic. Too bad. It could have been good.
