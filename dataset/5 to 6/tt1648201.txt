This movie was visually beautiful, the music was incredible, any movie that uses Jeff Buckley is a win for me. There was not much of a story to speak of, lovers reunite, travel, etc. It was more a series of very wonderful shots of the scenery and Stana Katic as much as it was a movie. You could basically watch the first 20 minutes, then the last 10 and you have the gist of the movie.Anyway the biggest reason I could never recommend this movie, the sound/audio is impossibly bad. I wanted to stop watching from the first scene on, it was that bad. The background noise was just too much and no settings change could fix it. I understand 'art' films, but could they not a afford a boom Mic for the scenes with dialog? I would have enjoyed the movie more with subtitles.
