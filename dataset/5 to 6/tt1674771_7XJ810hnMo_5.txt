It's no masterpiece, but they weren't aiming for that. It's for fans of the show who want to see the boys back together. A kind of celebration of Entourage, with cameos all over the place - fun to watch. It's lost some charm of the TV show, but it's still escapism and entertainment.It's out of its depth as a movie on the big screen though, but it's better than nothing. It's a good way to wrap the whole thing up. I highly doubt we'll see them ever again.This time, there's more money, more girls, and more of everything. I'm giving it 6 out of 10 because it tries to fit too much into 90 minutes which would have taken possibly a whole season otherwise. It's clunky and heavy-handed compared with the TV show. The problem with a movie is that we don't get the cliff-hangers we got with each episode. Nor do we get to see details explored in depth. In a movie, everything is compressed into 90 minutes, and it changes the flow to something that doesn't feel right. The writing is "safe". It's in 'movie-mode', and there's a formula at work. Again, less charm than the TV show.Lastly, the movie that Vince directs, "Hyde" looks like a music video clip not a movie. We see only a small clip, but it looks like a trailer.We should have seen more on set of Hyde, with Vince directing. But we don't see much at all because there's too many girls in bikini scenes to get through. They never showed Vince working his magic on set, which I think could have been explored more to gain at least some credibility and rise, even for a moment, above the juvenile materialism. Some of the comedy is a bit weak too. But in the end, it's Entourage, so you go along for the ride, and enjoy it even with its flaws.
