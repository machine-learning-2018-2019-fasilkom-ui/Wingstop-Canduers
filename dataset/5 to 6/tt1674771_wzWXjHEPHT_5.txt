Vincent Chase is married but his wife walks out on their honeymoon. He decides to have a party and his former agent now Studio boss Ari Gold offers him a big role. He would do it only if he gets to direct. Some time later, the movie is almost done but over budget. Ari Gold is not happy and has to get the money from Texan Larsen McCredle and his son Travis. He's stressed as usual. Lloyd Lee is getting married. E's ex Sloan is having his baby. Vince is hot for Emily Ratajkowski. Turtle is now rich and he fights Ronda Rousey.The gang is back and it's the same old, same old. I'm a fan of the TV show but the last few seasons were marking time. The movie has many more cameos. There are probably too many. Ronda Rousey is not necessarily a good actress but she's still better than Emily Ratajkowski. Rousey and Turtle are actually a cute couple. Ari is great as usual and I love his part of the movie. On the other hand, E's melodrama isn't fun. The story isn't quite there. There is not enough good material for a TV episode, let along a whole movie.
