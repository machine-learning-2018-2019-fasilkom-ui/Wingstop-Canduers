The story is nice , new idea ,, the plot escalates smoothly , but it was a bit slow maybe cause the language was mixed between french, Italian, German and English as a second language !! The thing is i imagined if the cast would be all native English speakers if it would get any better ,, but it would change the whole idea of an Italian marrying German girl and hit a french one ;) so generally it all worked out ,There were some comedy bits , reasonably laughable especially when the Italian guy talks about how Paris is the most Italian city outside of Italy :D .the Set in Paris is amazing , and that's coming from a guy who was in Paris once. anyway,, it was a good movie :)
