I just read some of the longest reviews in history which totally missed the point . . . women are human, and will behave as such, which is fascinating. The only problem for me as a father was the baby being left alone on the front porch, none of my babysitters would have done this even on a bad day. Been looking forward to this one for a while and was a bit disappointed to be honest, it could have been exceptional with a few changes.I believe this film is worth a view as long as you are not expecting too much. Elizabeth Banks is solid as is Diane Lane and the other actors, directing is decent. OK movie based on good writing. 5/10
