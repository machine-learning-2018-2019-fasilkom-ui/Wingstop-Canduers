Can you release a better title then 11-11-11? It only happens once in your life. The hype was going on especially due the director, Darren Lynn Bousman, who directed Saw 2,3 and 4 but it's always fault to put such a thing as a promotion on your DVD or Blu Ray. The story is very simple, on the 11-11-11 things will go wrong with the world, the devil will unleash his demons on humanity. This is surely not another Saw, this is way back in time back to the seventies and eighties were some flicks were made about possession, or demons attacking the world. There is no blood to reckon in it and there's a lot of talking going on, still, I kept watching because I wanted to know what was going on. It slowly reveals itself and some will see the end coming of this flick from miles away. The acting was rather good and you believed in Joseph Crone (Timothy Gibbs) one we have seen before in The Kindred and Witchboard 2. He really had to carry this flick but succeeded. But it's just a horror who needs the scary parts and there aren't that many in 11-11-11. The demons do appear on a regular base but nothing really happens until the end. If you like supernatural or flicks about possession or demons then this is for you but at the end, 11-11-11 pasted and nothing happened at all, just like in this flick.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5
