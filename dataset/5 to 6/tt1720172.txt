This movie Could have been Great! It's really creepy! It's well acted! It's well directed! The music is astoundingly good! St. Charles, Illinois never looked so good on the big-screen! However, watching Munger Road is kind of like watching The Blair Witch Project with the last 10 minutes of the film missing. The film is missing a conclusion. Munger Road does a wonderful job of creating tension, suspense and then pops all of that beautiful momentum like a balloon in your face without even attempting an adequate, plausible, or even fantastic explanation. It just ends! Which is really a big let down because most of this film is really good. So it you don't mind watching a good horror movie without an ending by all means check out Munger Road.
