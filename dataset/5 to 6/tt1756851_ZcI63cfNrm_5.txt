I just saw it and really liked it despite all the negative things i heard about it. I liked it more than Tetro (6/10) and Youth without youth (4/10), Coppola's last two movies. Twixt was like watching a PC adventure game like Phantasmagoria or Garbiel Knight adapted into a movie (showing only the video parts of the games). It was intriguing and had very nice digital cinematography and Gothic horror atmosphere. Plot and setting reminded me of In the mouth of madness as well as Twin Peaks. It was also nice to see Val Kilmer again. As much as i love his masterpieces from the 70's, this small personal movie was also very interesting (though of course i'm not even comparing them). Coppola does what he wants to do, not caring about money and reviews and i respect that. A similar case (minimalistic too) was with Soderbergh's Bubble. Overall i gave it a 6.5/10. p.s. I read some people say that it is incoherent and the plot doesn't make any sense. I didn't have a problem following the plot and i understood what happened in the end quite easily. It isn't explained very clear (wisely in my opinion) but all the hints are there.
