The previous reviewer wrote just about everything that can be written about this documentary. I second everything that was stated.All this documentary does is confirm that Juarez, Mexico is a dangerous place. I think the general public is well aware of that fact and no plans are being made to have summer vacations there. It makes a lot of claims as to why the violence exists, and is probably mostly correct, yet it doesn't do much to suggest any viable resolution. There is mention of seeming efforts to quell the violence from Pres. Obama and Pres. Calderón, but you get the feeling that it is of little importance to the US.Disappointingly, there's not much original footage of things happening currently in Juarez. Most footage of for the documentary was from previously aired news-casts, or zooming in and out of photos.Overall I think it is worth watching if for nothing else to inform people of the reality that exists so close to our boarder.
