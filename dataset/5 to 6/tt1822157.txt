8 Murders a Day jumped out at me as an important documentary about an important subject, the drug war and the problem with the cartels and corruption in Mexico. It falls short though, adds very little in the way of facts and information, contains mostly very blurry footage and a repetitive soundtrack, and soundtrack is stretching it, the same sound loop is played over and over throughout the documentary even through the final credits. This causes the movie to be especially boring and although one isn't supposed to enjoy this movie about atrocities, it is very distracting. Yes, legalizing drugs in the U.S. would put the cartels out of business and probably stop most of the violence on both sides of the borders, but because leaders get so much money and power from it on both sides of the border, it isn't likely to ever happen. People in positions of power like the status quo and will fight any efforts to change it.
