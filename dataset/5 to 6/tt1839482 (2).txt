I feel this movie was a movie of two halves Interesting first half when Anna Paquin relocates with her two daughters and through Drea De Matteo she gets involved in criminal activity. Not sure what she was doing mind you, she was earning lots of money but not sure what for and why they were using her other than finding suitable boats. Second half she kinda changes personality and becomes more motherly and it dissolves into cheesy melodrama. Anna Paquin in all fairness looks great in that bikini and tiny denim shorts etc. Not sure if she was the correct casting choice. She has a strange mouth, I like the little gap in her teeth but her mouth shape is weird. Still she is very capable actress. Smoking to much though, not sure why her character had to be a chainsmoker. All in all , not to bad but not great. Nice reveal of the real life Christine at the end.
