I just saw this yesterday, and was left with mixed emotions. The film has some qualities, but it doesn't really follow through. As others have pointed out, the film follows a very simple love story, and there's nothing wrong with that as long as it's well-executed, but this wasn't. Throughout the film I never really cared about the relationship, mostly because it wasn't developed enough to be interesting, but it I also didn't find the characters to be likable. Most of the screen time with the two leads is them either staring at each other or having sex, most of which doesn't further the story what so ever.It's all very Swedish-film-y, if you wanted to you could probably make a drinking game out of every time a character breaks a long tense silence with -Du..?, and you are constantly reminded of the upper-middle-class-ness of the characters. Another thing that bothered me is that EVERY SINGLE ONE the characters smoke. It's not that I think it's bad, there's just no point of it, it doesn't bring anything to the movie and it isn't really realistic either. The most memorable scene for me is when they see deer in the woods, but I actually think the film would be better without it. It doesn't fit, it just looks as if they've taken left-over footage from a LOKA commercial and put it in for effect.Basically, it's OK, but not more. The acting is uneven and the entire movie becomes nauseatingly predictable and over-emotional towards the second half. If you're only going to see one Swedish film with lesbians 'fucking åmål' is far superior.
