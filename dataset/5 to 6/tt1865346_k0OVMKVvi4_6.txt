Having run into a swarm of questionable and dubious low-budget zombie movies the last couple of months, I really had no particular high hopes for "Detention of the Dead", but I was genuinely surprised.The movie starts out well enough and drops the action right in your lap almost right away. I enjoyed that and it was great not having to sit 30 or 45 minutes into the movie before action starts to happen and the movie to pick up pace. "Detention of the Dead" starts off in a high gear and keeps going at that pace."Detention of the Dead" has a good amount of comedy to it to make it a worthy addition to the genre where you would find "Shaun of the Dead". While it is not as classic as "Shaun of the Dead", "Detention of the Dead" does manage to leave a good mark on the zombie comedy genre.The effects in the movie were nice, though not as gory and detailed as that in George Romero movies or "The Walking Dead". But still, for a movie of this type and budget, then the effects and make-up was quite alright.The characters in the movie were nicely detailed and equally well performed by the people hired for the various roles.Story-wise, then the movie didn't really bring anything new to the zombie genre. But still, it managed to take already established lore in the zombie genre and put it to good use. There were some nice enough, although cheesy, references to be seen here and there, so stay alert."Detention of the Dead" is a good addition to the zombie movie library of any zombie aficionado.
