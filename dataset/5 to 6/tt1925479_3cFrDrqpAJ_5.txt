It's better than "Brake", and certainly more entertaining than "Somewhere".I rented "Pawn" and "Officer Down" last night for a b-cop-double-feature. Pawn was alright, but Officer Down gets the nod out of the two for its' better acting across the board.It marginally works as a character study.The pacing is alright and the writing isn't half-bad.The film needed a bit more interaction and back-story to the marriage/wife - which might have added some genuine drama. Really, that was the problem with both of these movies.While this is a "b" movie, and I am rating it a 6(56/100), I'm not going to be adding to my "jeremy's B Movie marathon list". I don't know that I can give this my recommendation, but there are certainly worse options in the redbox.The film has just enough surprises, and that 'better than usual' performance from the lead that makes this slightly better than average, and certainly better than most of the b-straight-to-DVD fair that's out there.
