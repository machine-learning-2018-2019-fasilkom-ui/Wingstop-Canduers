Why You Might Like It: This is decent action/drama that revolves around a once corrupt police officer unknowingly investigating his own corrupt police department and trying to find out who saved his life after he was gunned down. There is plenty of action and recognizable faces including Stephen Dorff, Dominic Purcell, and James Woods that do a solid job in their roles. If you enjoy corrupt cop films or movies that involve a cop investigating crimes with twists and turns, then you will likely find that this movie is worth a watch.Why You Might Not Like It: What stood out the most to me was that the movie is all over the place and has a lot going on. There are numerous flashbacks and in some cases they are hard to spot, which makes the movie a little confusing. Overall, the story isn't outstanding and the movie plays out to be very mediocre. To me, the movie is very average in almost all aspects, which means it likely isn't worth your time unless you really like one of the actors or really enjoy this genre of film.Acting/Casting: 5.5* Directing/Cinematography/Technical: 5*Plot/Characters: 5* Entertainment Value: 5* Total - 5.5+5+5+5 = 20.5/4 = 5.125*
