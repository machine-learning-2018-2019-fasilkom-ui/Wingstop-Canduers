While there may have been an over exuberance of evil snake films in the past few years following the release of Snakes on a Plane, it is still possible for one to experience such a film with great enjoyment. That is where Venom comes in. The next time you have a pizza in the car and are hitting up the Redbox, check out this fun sci-fi flick. As Helen and Lilly are driving through the desert, on their way to spend some quality mother-daughter time together. They mistakenly run over a snake, and don't think anything of it. Later, they run over something else, and discover that the former snake's mate is actually hunting them down. The pair becomes involved with murderous drug dealers as well, throwing more danger and excitement into the mix.While not Oscar-bait, Venom provides a thoroughly entertaining movie for any Friday or Saturday night with the friends. The main draw of the friend is the emotional bond shared between the mother and daughter. What starts out as bitter resentment turns into a shared fight for survival. Another way in which the film stands out from its peers is with what I will call it's "snake- o-vision," the point of view of the snake as it approaches its victims. Venom proves that it is another great addition to the films that thrive in the darkness on Saturday night. Campy and fun, Venom is one to enjoy with a large group of friends, pizza, and a couple beers.
