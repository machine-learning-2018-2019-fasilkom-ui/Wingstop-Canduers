I honestly don't know what to make of this film. I think if it had two major stars as the main characters and a great director it could have been an Oscar winner. It really wanted to be good but in the end failed. The problem is, I'm not entirely sure where it failed. I think it was the acting. There again, it may have been the direction. I don't know, so it was probably both. Great idea and I found that I really,really,really wanted to enjoy it but in the end, just felt deflated. Having said that if they'd put say George Clooney and Brad Pitt in as the leads and Tarantino or Fincher directing, I'm sure I'd have loved it. Just shows how shallow I am, but I bet 100 to 1, most who watch will secretly agree. Worth the watch though!
