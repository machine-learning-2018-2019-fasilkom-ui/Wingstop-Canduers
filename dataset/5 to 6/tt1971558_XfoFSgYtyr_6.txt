This movie is everything I read in the review I read here. It is an80's style slasher film. Acting is not that bad,filming,lighting, sound, not bad. Especiallyconsideringthe budget. Make you kind of wonder what this crew could do with a budget of a million or more and very much more what did some directors do with the millions they had for their work and ended up a lot worst than this here. I actually liked this movie. Of course there is nothing new here, it has all been said and done several times over. That being said it has been 30 years since so it was kind of a trip to go down this lane again. If I was to compare the quality overall of this film vs the budget that did it with I would truly have to say great job. I have seen too many million dollar films that were just so awful and to have this quality for so little its just surprising.
