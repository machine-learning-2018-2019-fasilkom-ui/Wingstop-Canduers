The movie was enjoyable and entertaining.This is a story of a app developer that creates an app to spy on anyone's phone. He randomly chooses a girl in trouble and the movie follows him trying to help her. I would question parts of the story that may not hold together. for example, why would someone having the intention to blackmail only keep printed photographs and not have a digital copy. why would someone have a digital photograph and not save it on the cloud etc... However if you don't question that and take the movie at a face value, it is fast paced, action packed and entertaining.
