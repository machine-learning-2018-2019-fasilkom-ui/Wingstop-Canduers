I had no hopes for this before I watched it. In fact, I passed on seeing it twice before. However, the writer wrote a very charming movie. It was executed very well. It's about Artie (Reece Thompson), a 21 yr old boy, who's been in love with April (Rebekah Brandes) ever since he's been a kid. She moves away, and 3 years later, Artie decides to go find her, but his luck sucks, his car breaks down, and he goes back home. However, a zombie apocalypse has taken place, and nowhere is safe for him. His family is not in their home, but zombies are. After killing them, he wanders through the woods and meets up with Regan (Stephanie Hunt), who has recently lost her family to zombies. They walk until they come to a church where they meet a priest who turns out to be a zombie killer. Artie's time with Regan and the priest doesn't last very long, and soon he's on the road again, this time with a child hood friend of his. It was MUCH better than I thought it would be. The biggest name in this movie is Mark Rolston (Private Drake from Aliens), and he's barely in it, so that should give you an idea that they didn't spend much on the movie. This will not take the place of The Walking Dead, Dawn of the Dead, or any of the other zombie immortal titles, but I thought it was clever, fun, and charming. I recommend this.Do not expect great special effects or awesome kills. As I said, I think this was low budget, so watch it with that in mind. Without giving away any spoilers, I'll say that I didn't like the end. After watching it, you'll see why. I gave this a 6-star rating.
