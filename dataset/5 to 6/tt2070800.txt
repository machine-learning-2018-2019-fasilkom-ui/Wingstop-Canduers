I'm no reviewer but this film needs to be reviewed.
The first shots were a little bit wobbly but after that they were perfectly beautiful. The locations are gorgeous. I envied that they found places where there were no signs of modern life. Casting is good but I wondered about the chubby caveman. How did he get chubby? What was he eating? He must have been related to the family and friends that made this film. Take this for a comedy. Its funny. And exciting and different. The chicken plays its part well. It didnt lay an egg. That would have been the sequel.
