Essentially a series of interviews conducted at key moments along an Appalachian Trail thru- hike, "Beauty Beneath the Dirt" captures the youthful exuberance of a hiking trio as they meet the physical and mental challenges of their adventure. It gives little sense of the Trail as a community or unique experience, but that is not the film's goal. The A.T. is merely a backdrop for the interactions of the three characters. As is typical at their stage of life, these people come across as self-absorbed navel- gazers who nonetheless capture the viewer's interest with their physical attractiveness and engaging on-camera manner, if not their sincerity. It would be interesting to see the reaction of their fellow hikers to their constant self-documentation on video; one need only refer to their trail name, "The Traveling Circus," to guess that there was some irony inherent in giving them that moniker.
