I've seen A lot worse hood-movies on DVD's than this so it's a bit surprising watching it that no one picked it up for release.The Director (and producer, writer, editor and even actor as 'Jared') of the movie; Martin Bentsen decided that when it was never picked up instead of letting it go to waste instead put it up for free on youtube so kudos for him for that, I think more people should do that.Anyways, the movie is a bit reminiscent of 'FLY BY NIGHT (1992)' about 2 different rappers starting a project together, 1 who's tired of rapping the same old 'get money, get hoes' type of raps that is popular and the other with an idea to blend classical music with rap.Now, the idea of blending classical music rap is (even though the movie makes it out to be) not a new one (violinist Miri Ben Ari have made songs with rappers for years, and there's been plenty of examples even before her doing the same 'C U WHEN U GET THERE' with Coolio and the whole 'THE RAPSODY' compilation with rappers collaborating with Opera singers in the 90's).But that's easy to look aside, and the music is pretty good (I'd personally add a harder drum beat but that's me lol, but I'd listen to that for sure).There is a romance sub-plot with a girl in the movie that never truly feels all that legit, and it's nothing that will blow you away but the 2 leads are likable and pulls off pretty good performances and overall it's a decent watch.
