Sometimes I agree with some low ratings. But sometimes people's ratings Are just completely so far out of whack it isn't even funny. They are so off that I don't even think a new one would fix the problem. It is more likely the person behind the scale. People come on here and throw one's around like they are like it is their first time at the strip club. Honestly, this is not the Worst movie you will ever see. I promise you... Not even close. If it is, then I am really sorry for you. I wonder the what the three worst movies you saw Before this was.But I am not here to attack people who rate movies ones. I just really feal like It really does throw some people off of movies that they may have actually liked. Now maybe this movie isn't one of em'. Maybe other People won't like this Either. But it ain't no 1. I actually I agree with another poster. For a low-budget Film this was a pretty decent film. And I really like Danielle Harris. She definitely Wasn't in the movie enough. But the movie had a good plot, little mystery in it, had its share of blood, and the setting that the movie took place in was cool. The only thing it really lacked was money for some big time production. But for What they had, they pulled it off pretty damn good. Definitely your lower level average horror movie. 5-6 but definitely watchable!
