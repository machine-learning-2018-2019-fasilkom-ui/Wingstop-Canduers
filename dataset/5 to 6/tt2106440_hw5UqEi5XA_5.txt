Hallow's Eve is a pretty cool late night horror flick. I really enjoyed the Halloween haunted fun house theme. Im a huge Danielle Harris and Tiffany Shepis fan, so i was excited to check this out, even though i saw this movie was distributed by Barnholtz entertainment. The plot was pretty easy to follow, a group of friends get invited to a small towns annual Halloween haunted country theme park. These friends years before were involved in a cruel prank that leaves a young girl severely injured and hal of her face disfigured. Now as a teen, she helps her family operate the haunted house attractions. As the night goes on, the responsible teens begin to be killed off. This revenge slasher is one of those where the killer is unmasked in the end. I found it pretty cool that people touring the attractions was convinced some the bodies were fake, when they were actually being killed. Not much of a twist to the killers identity though. And the kills were pretty graphic. Good set design also. This movie was fun, its worth at least a watch.
