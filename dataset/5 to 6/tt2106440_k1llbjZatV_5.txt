I know for a fact that if this movie wasn't named Hallows Eve I would've never even gave it a second glance.I LOVE Halloween &amp; will really watch just about any movie based around the holiday.I wouldn't say Hallows Eve is a great movie but it was OK.It's worth watching once but ONLY once.After watching it, I don't think it's a movie you'll watch ever again.For the budget it was made on, I think they did a pretty good job.The special effects were just gross.If you're into that sort of thing then you might like this movie.The thing that stood out the most for me in Hallows Eve was Stephen Medvidick.He was GREAT as the (I can't use the words I really want to here) stoner Rudy.His character was the type of guy you wonder why you're friends with him in the 1st place.I want to check out other movies he's been in now..Hallows Eve was a pretty decent movie but like I said before, I don't think it's a movie you'll watch more than once
