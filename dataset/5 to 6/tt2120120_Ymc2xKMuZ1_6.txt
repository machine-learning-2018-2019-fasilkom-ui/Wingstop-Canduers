I enjoyed it, Pixels is much better than people say. It has some really funny parts, and if you grew up in the 80's and played some old games you will like this I am betting. Of course there are some silly parts, but that's how all Adam Sandler movies are. It reminded me a bit of Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore. It was fun to watch.Ignore the reviews from critics, the SJW's these days will find anything to complain about and they did with this movie too. They want everything, whether it be a movie, video game, or comic book to cater to them. Anything they find offensive immediately they claim to be insulting and they will overlook anything good about the movie just so they can talk negatively about it. Never listen to an SJW when it comes to reviews, they are awful critics.Watch a movie, and judge it for yourself.
