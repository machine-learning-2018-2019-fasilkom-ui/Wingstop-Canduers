The do co is about a bunch of young adults who invest time and money round Sept and Oct of every year to build and run a haunted house during the Halloween season.I gave it a 5 due to the suspense factor, watching these guys operate hand tools was frightening in itself, I thought the female was going to lose her hair for sure. The main guy was your garden variety knuckle head 'wannabe supervisor' that had big ideas, but a lack of personality, funds, and technical ability. There were several pathetic arguments between co-workers about nothing, which was quite entertaining. The props they tried to build were no better than what you might see at a high school performance, and hours before the first show, they still had things to finish and were stressed out.But I must say, overall, I did enjoy it, I thought the guys doing the do co did a great job, they didn't edit all the nasty, juicy bits out, and ended up making these guys look like the bunch of incapable individuals that they were. You can't help but feel sorry for them at certain times, but you also know that they are kinda their own worst enemy. If you like watching train wrecks, you'll enjoy the implosion that is 'Monsters Wanted'.
