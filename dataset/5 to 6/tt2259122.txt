While I like the film and the short I feel like the director should have made it a two part movie with the first part being set in the 90's and then the second part being set in the early/late 2000's with the actors from part one taking on roles in part to as parents, teachers, and coaches in part two. I'm not a fan of splitting movies into two parts, but this movie felt like it was two different movies set in the same universe. I also have to agree with other reviewers when they said that the universe that was set up was inconsistent as they had the girls playing football, but they had male coaches and male announcers which should have been made female it's just a minor detail, but it would have made the universe seem more realistic with girls playing sports it would be them who would have more knowledge what's going on during the game. I would have taken it one step further by having none of my female cast wearing skirts or dresses as they would be seen as boy's clothes. The movie is good and I do recommend it.
