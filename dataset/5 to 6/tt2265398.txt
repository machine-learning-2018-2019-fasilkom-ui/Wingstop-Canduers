Neither bad or approaching anything remotely good, Drinking Buddies is a more an acting improv exercise than a film. There's nothing cinematic here and the small servings of drama and comedy are lost in a film that never finds its purpose to exist. Taking place in a few locations, with no script, the cast does a decent job of keeping this mostly watchable, but with such little substance, the film is practically vapor by the end credits. Drinking Buddies is the kind of quiet film that attempts and almost approaches honesty through its everyday people characters, but watching these people get drunk and flirt feels more and more distancing to the viewer as the film goes on - its getting a small peek at a slice of life from a few very believable, but uninteresting characters. There hits a point that spending time with these people has worn out its welcome and their little story is undeserving of big screen treatment. There's no eye rolling moments here, but it's a dramatic flatline of a film that amounts to being nothing more than a time waster.
