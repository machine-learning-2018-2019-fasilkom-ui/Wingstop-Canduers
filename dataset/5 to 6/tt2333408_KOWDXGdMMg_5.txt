I doubt that most viewers will know anyone other than Edward Herrmann and Nancy Stafford from Christmas Roses. Still it's a wonderful family film produced it looks like under Mormon auspices.The two are the heads of a pair of orphanages the girl who grows up to be Bailee Michelle Johnson is placed. They couldn't be more opposite in their approach. Stafford kind of reminds me of Greer Garson when she played Edna Gladney in Blossoms In The Dust. The baby named Rose is just left on the door of her orphanage and she's just taken no questions asked. In fact Stafford because she came as an infant just regards her as her own.But in what looks like an influenza epidemic many of the kids died and so does Stafford. The survivors are either adopted or scattered to other orphanages. And Johnson comes under the care of Edward Herrmann, a most strict man who is all about the rules.Johnson who took her life lessons from Stafford turns out to be tougher than you would think. She not only takes a lot of buffeting, but she also softens a few hearts as well.I agree with the other reviewer in that Christmas Oranges even under religious auspices never gets preachy. It's a nice family film and should be seen.
