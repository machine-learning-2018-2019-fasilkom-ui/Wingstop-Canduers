Caught up in a dicey loan deal, Cam (Taylor Lautner), a New York bike messenger stumbles into the exhilarating world of parkour when he crashes into Nikki (Marie Avgeropoulos), a beautiful stranger. Quite reluctantly, Nikki introduces Cam to her crew of freerunners who appear to have some shady undercurrents. Desperate to be free of his debt, Cam gets caught up in a criminal world that begins to crumble around him as he struggles to protect that which is most important to him.The slick parkour adds dynamic flair and physicality to the fight and chase scenes, while the seamlessly captured rhythm of the choreography makes the thrilling action easy to follow. The rapid pace forces you to keep moving forward, not allowing time to look back, much the same as the parkour requires you to constantly consider the next obstacle. The tactile sport serves the gritty aesthetic well and Lautner's ease of ability in the parkour scenes is mesmerising.Apart from the action, Tracers offers an authentic look at the difficulties faced by people desperate to find their place in the world. The sincerity of the plot enables you to connect with Cam's plight, but the film avoids drowning in it's own drama by not taking itself too seriously. The initial scenes are fun and full of youthful exuberance as Cam hones his new skills, but as the stakes become higher, he must use these skills to stay alive.Tracers is an action packed adrenaline rush with some gripping twists. Fans of freerunning will appreciate the integration of the sport while action lovers will enjoy a fresh perspective on the genre. There is nothing exceedingly complex to be found here, although the thrilling finale will leave you needing a moment or two to catch your breath.
