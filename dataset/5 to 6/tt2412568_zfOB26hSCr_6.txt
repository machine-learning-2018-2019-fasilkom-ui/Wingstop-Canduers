I agree with a reviewer above that the movie did not project the whimsical Rich as seen in the delivery of his talks at concerts. Way too serious and broken. Rich had a way of being broken and still showed a child like love of Jesus in his words, but in the movie he was always angry. And one thing that bugged me is that his haircut seemed to change on a whim. A sequence with short hair was followed by a sequence with long hair and a beard and then back to short hair - over and over. May sound silly, but as far as movie production goes that should not happen.Overall, it is a good insight to a man struggling with his faith. And the Brennan Manning character was great.
