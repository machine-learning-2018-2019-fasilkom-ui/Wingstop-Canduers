An interesting neo-noir that plods along with all your familiar noir characters: the morally compromised ex-military lonelier, the desperate guy with lots of money on the run from the authorities and/or mob and, of course, the reptilian femme fatale who telegraphs her long-term plan that nobody seems to ever pick up on, along with her expected black garter belt and nylons, natch.Will keep you satisfied for a while up until the point you realize you've seen a similar plot in a much better film. OK, it's got a more fatalistic spin and I'm a sucker for aggressive hot brunettes wearing lingerie, so worth a look.
