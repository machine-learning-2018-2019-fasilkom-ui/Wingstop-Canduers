"If you and Edith weren't so good at writing letters..." Johanna Parry (Wiig) is a caregiver who has worked for the same woman since she was 15. During this time she rarely left the house and lived a sheltered life. When she passes she takes a job working for an elderly man and his granddaughter Sabitha. Sabitha isn't excited about having a nanny so her and her friend respond to a letter Johanna wrote to Sabitha's father Ken (Pearce). This starts in motion a "relationship" that unintentionally helps everyone involved. This is another movie that is hard to review. The acting is good and the story is interesting and very well written. The only downside is that its just like watching real life. There is really no excitement or any real intrigue. Not even a will they/wont't they feeling. Kristin Wiig is starting to become like Bill Murray in the way that she either does laugh-out-loud-rolling-in-the-aisles comedy or very deliberately paced not quite comedy/not quite drama films. This is a movie that when it was over my only thought was...huh, so that's done. Overall, not a bad movie but it was like watching real life play out and that's really not why I watch movies. I like to have something in it that makes me think. This didn't. I give it a C.
