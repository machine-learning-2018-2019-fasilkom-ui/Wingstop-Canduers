Director Mr. Indra Kumar work is fine. He made the silent scenes more hilarious than the scenes with punch lines. He has justified this adult comedy genre in good way. A scene, when Aftab comes out from bull is hilarious, even it is a silent one. Big drawback of this movie is it's scrap story. Screenplay is also simple. Dialogues by Milap Zaveri, are the highlight of film. It is very clear that first they had selected the A rated jokes from all other sources then thought how to stuff them. So, outcome is no story and linear screenplay. Most of the jokes are already heard. After all, they will make you smile at least. I appreciate the makers honesty that they had already given clear cut indication about the content of film in trailer and promos. Performance wise Ritesh Deshmukh is brilliant. He does his scenes with lots of ease and makes the even dull scenes interesting. His dialogues delivery is also very good. Vivek Obrai and Aftab Shivdasani are OK. I am unable to distinguish between all female actors but they are so so. Music wise title track composed by Sanjeev Darshan is good and another "Mamla set kar le.." composed by Anand Raj Anand is good.
