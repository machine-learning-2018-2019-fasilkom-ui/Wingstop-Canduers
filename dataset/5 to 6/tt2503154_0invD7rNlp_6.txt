The movie is an interesting commentary on the internet being a distraction of stupidity.It leads people to their deaths, but people are addicted to watching others demise that it creates a sort of circle of dysfunction...Ultimately, I was engrossed as a sort of VHS style found footage genre offering, but it did have a few interesting things to say on the entitled society we live in today, of easy gratification, replacement of impersonal and fear based living behind a screen for the beauty of the natural world.It's available on demand, which is apropos to the plot point of the story.
