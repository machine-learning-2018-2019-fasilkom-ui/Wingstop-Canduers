I feel like Erica was quite a peculiar teenager, but it is understandable considering the fact that she didn't have a father and her mother was always in need of boyfriends. What weirded me out the most was how Erica's sex life started where it shouldn't have. I also hated the easy way she could talk about blackmail. She only realised the seriousness of her actions when her freedom was in question. But, I did have a love-hate relationship with her. I liked her for her strenght of character and the way she didn't care what people thought of her, but I didn't like the fact that that made her do illegal things.
