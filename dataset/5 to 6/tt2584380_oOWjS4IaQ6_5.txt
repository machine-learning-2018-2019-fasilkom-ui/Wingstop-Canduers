This was an easy movie to watch while multi-tasking. I don't usually watch these Hallmark Channel type movies, but made an exception for this one because it was set in fictional Bliss, Mississippi, my home state. So I am pretty critical about the fake Southern accents. Do movie and TV people realize that no Southerner of my generation or younger drops their r's anymore? They apparently listen to audio of Eudora Welty or Shelby Foote and think that's how we still speak here. Unfortunately, we don't. The town, especially the B&amp;B, featured in the movie was beautiful, but there are no towns or buildings in Mississippi that even remotely look like them. As I suspected, the credits revealed the movie was filmed in Canada. Could they not even take a half-hour to go online and look at a few photos of Southern small towns?
