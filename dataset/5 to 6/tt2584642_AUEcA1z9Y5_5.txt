I used to love me a good zombie movie. I really did. But thanks to Walking Dead, I have to watch a new one every damn day. I mean it, every day. And I really mean that I have to watch them...because I AM ADDICTED TO ZOMBIES AND CANNOT STOP!! AMC has started a plague...and it isn't zombies...it's watching all zombie movies. The world is hooked.So anyway, this movie is about a fighter (who is of course a black guy and I think supposed to be played gay, it never says), a lesbian or something, and some other people. There are zombies. S**t goes down. You've seen it before, but this was the first time it called itself "Aftermath", so I gotta give it credit for that.I really don't get this age of schizophrenic films. Stick to the genre. It tries to be action sometimes. Well that didn't work for big budget trash like World War Z or James Gunn's Dawn of the Dead (I'm looking at YOU ZACH SNYDER YOU RUINER OF CHILDHOODS). It needs to be horror. It needs the scares. I got neither. At least Walking Dead has good characters. This just has a black guy.
