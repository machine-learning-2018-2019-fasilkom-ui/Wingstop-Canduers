Wastelander is a little bit of everything. At times it's a film which is classic Troma in the style of not comprehending certain plot points, not understanding how certain characters died, the action sequences, certain exteriors, the editing, etc.But then it's also a film which is up there with some very good Sci-Fi films by some of it's wonderful exterior shots, some of it's interesting characters and it's overall ambiance i.e. the gas masks, the creepy feel of the exteriors, the signs, etc. Then there's also a serene like quality about Wastelander in the same respects as The Bad Batch which is kind of touching. Wastelander is a film which explores all different aspects of film in general. Also, The acting isn't too bad either. Brendan Guy Murphy owns the character as Rhyous and could easily be cast as the next Mad Max. Sian Vilaire has an interesting style and look to her and could easily be cast as a villain in the next Avengers movie. Overall, Wastelander isn't a perfect film, but it's a very interesting one, and it's worth the watch.
