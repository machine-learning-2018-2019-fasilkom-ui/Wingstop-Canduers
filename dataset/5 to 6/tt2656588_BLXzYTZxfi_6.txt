Too real. Too uncomfortable. This is coming from somebody who loved The Comedy. But I think that's what the director was going for so I can't blame him for succeeding. The build up to the great ending just feels way too slow and the movie is way too repetitive. It's a short film drawn out into feature length and it feels that, hard. I'm going to keep comparing it to The Comedy. The Comedy was slow and story wise it had even less going on than Buzzard but it was much better filmed and while it doesn't exactly go anywhere it maintains the feeling of like it's going towards something terrible all through the movie. Buzzard has that same weird, uncomfortable tension (and it does build up to something) but it's soooooo slooooooooow.Nice effort. I'm glad it's a thing somebody made. But I didn't enjoy watching a second of it. Which is the point. But there are movies that have made the exact same point better.
