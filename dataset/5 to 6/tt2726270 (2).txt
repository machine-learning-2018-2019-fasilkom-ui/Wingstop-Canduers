In no way is this a good movie. It's unoriginal, it looks cheap and it's pretty bland. But, it's also not a terrible movie.
Is it yet another cheap and unoriginal home invasion movie? Yes. Is it at least a decent one of those? Also yes.
This movie isn't long and is reasonably well paced making it not boring. It hits all the notes you expect and doesn't do a terrible job at it. The villains are menacing, there is some genuine tension and you can easily find worse acting. If you're just looking for a competent mindless movie it's fine and what more should you want from a cheap slasher called Tormented?
To be perfectly honest I can't tell why it's got such a low score. No, it isn't good, that isn't my argument, but you could do a lot worse.
