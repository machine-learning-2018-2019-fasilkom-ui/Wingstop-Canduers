My quick rating - 5,2/10. A slightly above average home invasion movie that delivers on the scares. After a girl agrees to babysit on Halloween, a trick or treater shows up to turn her night into a living nightmare. The cat and mouse game between the woman(Alysa King) and the killers is well drawn out and leads to a bit more plot then the usual. A decent attempt at trying something a little different in a genre that is stale and really doesn't give a whole lot of wiggle room for creativity. I guess the message so far in these movies is "Dont answer the door for trick or treaters" since they may end up being there to distract you for someone else to slaughter you. That should make you feel better in 18 days from now...(depending on what day your community allows trick or treating)
