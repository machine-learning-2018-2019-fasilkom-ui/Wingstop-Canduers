If you even hit play on this film, you know what you're getting into. It's corny, bad acting, horrible plot, the usual B film about Mayan "noble savages." Weird combination of facts and new age theories as one other user mentioned. Good option if you know you're going to fall asleep, and if you manage to stay awake it's at least "so bad it's good"-ish.
