I was pretty underwhelmed after watching the movie. Disney needs to rethink what live action movies they are making. The jungle book was renown and popular and almost everyone knew about the same and it was a good retelling of the story nothing spectacular but enjoyable. Pete's dragon at least for me was a film that I had no prior knowledge about and after seeing the film the content of the original story seems to be pretty bland. This is a film purely for kids below 10 years. The dragon is very well animated but the acting by the child actors is average at the best. the "villain" is shoehorned just for the sake of it. The content just was not riveting enough and it is a boring and bland 2 hour movie with some moments which will draw out an emotional response and those are very few and far between. If you have kids go watch it with them they would surely enjoy it. The theater I went had majority of the audience in the 6-10 year group and there were enough giggles and awes to know that they were enjoying the movie. Only recommended for kids.
