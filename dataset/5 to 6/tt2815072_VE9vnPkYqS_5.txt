Indigenous offers the well-known concept of lost tourists on an exotic location where they meet hostile entity. It highly resembles other fiction movies or even miniseries from Discovery channel. To its credit, it gives nice visual of the setting and there is effort to produce horror, but ultimately it is a straightforward and tired endeavor.The story might work to its advantage as audience gets exactly what they expect. There's little diversity here, even in recent year there are several movies with same theme. A few college kids take vacation in a beautiful place, and then they are inexplicably going to ominous site even though there are plenty of visible warnings.Visual is pretty good, the use of location is commendable, although when the encounter happens during nighttime, it reverts to jittery cam. The movie is shot mostly on third person, so it shouldn't encounter this issue like many mockumentary movies. Fortunately, the practical effect works well and it doesn't shy away from displaying the monster instead of maintaining blurry shots.Script does what it needs to, though surprisingly the actors perform admirably. They mostly look genuine, either through occasionally adequate presentation of the horror or the acting itself. In latter half, the movie opts for different gimmick and tries to broaden the scale, a decent effort but not entirely novel.Indigenous is exactly one would expect from lost tourist horror theme, it's far from innovative, but it might just be sufficient in the small scope.
