I started off on the wrong foot with this film after reading a negative review I was determined not to like it, and for the first 30 mins or so my thoughts and feelings were flowing that way too.From the very being and introduction the film states the statistics of 3 billion people (I would hate to see their phone bill after getting in touch with that many folk). After the first 30mins of guys drinking, surfing, chatting, sunsets, sunrises and love making the film gathers some pace and action in the jungle with monsters - yikes!I gave this film a 6 not bad worth a check out.
