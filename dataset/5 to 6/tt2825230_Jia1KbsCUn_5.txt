03/16/2019 Viewers are forced to watch some fat faced little chubby girl "pretend smoke" endless cigarettes throughout this movie that she magically pulls out of her bubble @__ along with old time fire starters. (she needs them to ignite her pretend smokes and the occasional fire) In real life this kid has never smoked a single cigarette which is visibly apparent. Some idiot (director/producer/investor/relative/boyfriend/lover???) that got to choose who gets to be in this movie made the worst selection ever made when he chose her. Storyline? Absolutely asinine and it only gets worse from there. Bon Appetit
