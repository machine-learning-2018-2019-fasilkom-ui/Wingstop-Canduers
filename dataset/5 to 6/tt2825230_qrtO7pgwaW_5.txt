One of those pro or contra flicks, no in between and for me it was a contra. Sold as a horror I asked myself, where's the horror?It's not because it has some supernatural stuff going on that it immediately is a horror. Oh yes, it contains blood but it never becomes scary or even creepy. The story goes in a circle and it's killing the same person over and over again, every time in a different way. But it's the conversations that are sometimes a bit foolish. I thought by reading a few reviews that it was bloody as hell, for me it was underneath that. Not my cup of tea.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5
