It's not everyday that you see a pretty Victoria Secret model like Suki Waterhouse (Who plays a druggy drifter with no name) falls for a slightly peculiar middle-age in the streets and becomes his best friend while being stalked though it happens in this 105 minutes debut film of Tom Sierchio . Although the movie depicts a real unlikely story in its plot, It sort of succeeds to portray some genuine feelings of fallible people. "The Girl Who Invented Kissing" is infused with zero wrenching pathos and is stymied by a monotonous script. While It's unfair to ignore the noticeable performances by Vincent Piazza and Dash Mihok, it's also fair to say that Suki Waterhouse is a long way to claim that she's as good in movies as she's in catwalk. Finishing my short take, I'll say that "The Girl Who Invented Kissing" actually does not even innovate let alone invent anything but it's a movie worth putting time for, specially for those who like to commiserate with these imperfect people of the story....and specially a pill-popping drifter played by pretty Suki Waterhouse.
