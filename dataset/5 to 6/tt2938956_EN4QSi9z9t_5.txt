It is just heartbreaking to say I did not like a transporter movie. But still, I did not like this transporter movie, at all !! It is expected from a transporter series to have top notch action sequences with Jason Statham throwing some mind blowing dialogues that would make a fan jump from his/her seat. But this Transporter got neither great action sequences nor good dialogues. Ed Skrein tries his best to reach that level but fails in experience. His voice is a plus but still cannot deliver a good blow with his dialogue delivery. He also lacks that Badass look Jason used to have.I was literally expecting the entire time for the movie to pick up pace and satisfy the action thirst that action movie lovers would have, but it stayed that dull movie where Hero would fight for some girl the entire time and kiss her at last. (kissing the Heroine with all bruises on Hero's face is now like a symbol that movie is over).I don't know if they will make an other part of this but I only hope next one will be better. Verdict: If you are very bored on the weekend, take a family trip,but try to avoid Transporter Refuelled. This movie is only for Transporter series fans who just don't want to skip a movie in the series.
