Quick background: I like Jason Statham, I thought the first two transporter movies were awesome, but the third one was a let down. And this fourth attempt (without him) is just like the last one. I saw it in the cinema because there wasn't much else going on action wise. So I would only recommend this is if you have ran out of options. I don't think it is as bad as some have put it, as it does have some action, although the fighting leaves much to be desired and doesn't come close to JS skills. And to make it worse, some of it has been hidden! They tried to make up for it all with lots of beautiful women, and it may have worked a little.In summary, it's just an OK action movie. I wish JS got his act together and made another proper one.
