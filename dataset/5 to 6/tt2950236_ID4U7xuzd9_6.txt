In this movie, just about everyone is attempting to control some other person. There is overt control, there is manipulative control, there is suggestive control, there is, 'I am going to take over this relationship' kind of control.If you enjoy this sort of movie, this is a quite decent implementation, especially given the person who seemed least controlling pulls off an action of which his character and personality suggested he was incapable.Not my sort of dish, but it held my attention to the end, which means it wasn't half bad.
