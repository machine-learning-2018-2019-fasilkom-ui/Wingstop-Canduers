Aaha Kalyanam was a decent watch. Too much of Bollywood essence though in a Tamil movie. (Not a big fan of the same).This is probably what happens when a Hindi Production banner tries to make a remake. More research could have gone in to suit the movie according to Tamil culture. If you are making a movie about marriages, detail to small things are very important which this movie failed to give miserably. Why are we made to watch a Tamil movie with so much of Hindi culture reference? Too many songs and how much longer are movies going to explore the same egoistic nature between a man and woman? Give it a break. Climax made up for the overall mediocrity of the movie. Go for it, if you have not seen the original Hindi version.
