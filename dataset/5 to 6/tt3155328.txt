Jake Johnson (nerd from Jurassic World) plays an lazy degenerate with just enough likable charisma for me not to shut this off in the fist four minutes. A down on his luck addicted gambler is asked to hold a bag of dirty money while some dude does time. Take a wild guess what happens next? The gambling lows aren't low enough, would like to see this character suffer more. Jake's brother played by Joe Lo Truglio (Wet Hot American Summer/ The State) hits on all levels, would like him to be in more stuff like this, gave it a nice spark. The female lead was hot. It was good enough for me not to cancel my Netflix subscription. Happy Monday. ; ) Scooter
