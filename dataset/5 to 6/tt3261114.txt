I really couldn't get behind the way this movie was filmed. Maybe there was a time quota they had to fill but a little less than half of this doc could have been cut out. A lot of abstract angles of the track and silent close ups on drivers that's would be nice additions if they weren't 4 minutes long a piece.
That being said, I was still able to finish it and enjoyed what little bits of actual interviews there were.
