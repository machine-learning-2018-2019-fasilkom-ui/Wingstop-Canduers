I liked this movie. Im new to the faith based movies and just love them. One of the things Ive noticed is that I have to take my critics glasses off, because if I dont there will never be a christian movie I'd like because they're all flawed. I didnt care that the choice of Sean Bean was unrealistic because of the age thing..as someone said not too many people boxing at that age. The child actor...I dont think he was THAT bad. And yes the story seemed thrown together, like they didnt care, but in the end it's all about God. Thats what christian movies come down to. Whether all their lives christians or total newbies, that's what these movies are made for.
