But unfortunately she was framed and jailed. Reacher and Susan Turner teams ups to solve the mystery.Tom Cruise shines all the way. His screen presence was totally impressive and his action performances were top notch. His energy level is Cobie Smulders was equally impressive as Tom Cruise. But all the other characters were actually dull and was nothing.The storyline was an okay-ish but clichéd in most parts. It was predictable and the narration was pretty weak and slow. Some of the action scenes and car chase was good. A forgettable Sequel to the great action movie Jack Reacher.An action thriller which lacks thrills5.7 on 10As a TC fan, this one was disappointing.
