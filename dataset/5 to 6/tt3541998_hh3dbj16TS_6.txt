I liked this film. It is a very slow and thoughtful movie. The pace was slow and built toward some suspense. I would have liked a little more revelation and resolution with the female lead.Like who abused her so badly that she has permanent scars on her back. Maybe the WHO does not matter. What matters is that she is scarred. Two lovely people. One mentally ill, one providing mental health care.The music was beautiful and original. In fact the music was an intricate part of the film. The set was very plain, in fact this could be done as a play I think.It is a study in human behavior and the need to connect.
