I like the concept of a reality tv show going wrong, it's been done a fair few times before but generally in the horror genre.Here we see 6 people with camera's attached to their helmets sent into the desert to solve puzzles in hope of winning a potential 100k. Trouble is the more people who finish the lower the prize!When the staff member travelling with them dies unexpectedly they are thrown in to a real battle for survival. From the dangerous wildlife to the lack of water in the blistering heat and the inevitable betrayals of their team mates.2survive could have been a lot better but alas suffers from a lot of poor film making and questionable writing. Regardless this is a good effort and isn't even as predictible as you'd assume it would be.Great cover art, competent enough film, I'd happily recommend this to folks despite its glaring flaws.The Good:Converys the fear and threat very wellSolid ideasThe Bad:Some real flaws across the boardCouple of major plot holesThings I Learnt From This Movie:Challenges as difficult as those would never be present in a mindless made for morons reality showRunning face first into cacti is a silly thing to doMurdering people while being recorded by multiple sources makes perfect sense
