This movie doesn't hide the fact that it's paying a tribute to one of the best bollywood romantic movie ever made. The problem is since the release of DDLJ in 1995, countless movies have done the same. The lack of originality in the movie is pretty evident from the get go. Alia's father is against love marriage because his elder daughter's love marriage didn't work out. Ironically the father, played wonderfully by Ashutosh Rana, himself married love of his life. So it's hard to understand why he'd completely flip on the idea that love can lead to a successful marriage. Of course despite knowing her father's stance on love, she falls in one with Varun only a few weeks before her arranged marriage to a NRI. So begins Varun's effort to win over the father heart. If DDLJ was never released this movie probably wouldn't have looked so bad. Unfortunately when you know exactly how a movie is going to turn out, it takes away the joy of wonderment. I love Varun. I think he'll fit in wonderfully playing characters that need a blend of humour and action. Alia despite not being my favourite amongst the rush of newcomers, has potential to play wide range of characters. I think it's understandable that not all actors and actresses can find movies with unique storyline. This is especially difficult for newcomers who wants to do as many movies as they can to establish themselves in the industry but also wants to do good movies to establish their range and not be a typecast. Unfortunately unless the producers and directors decide to make good movies, it's the newcomers who'll face the problem of lack of creativity.
