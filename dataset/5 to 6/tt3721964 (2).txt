'Gringo (2018)' is an uneven and unsure piece, one that stumbles over its tone and pacing more times than you can count and yet manages to pick itself off the ground on pretty much every such occasion. Its massively slow start paves the way for an, at times, incredibly exciting but then strangely dull adventure with peaks and valleys of the highest and lowest proportions. It continuously cuts back to an all-star cast who sadly drain the life of the film as, though they are all brilliant, they each play narcissistic sociopaths who aren't nearly as radiant or interesting as David Oyelowo's eponymous hero - who is played to perfection and is earnestly enjoyable on many levels. The overall effect of the flick is an enjoyable but forgettable one, a sense that a better - if slightly more traditional - story resides somewhere inside this mess. It's not bad, but it's not great either. 6/10
