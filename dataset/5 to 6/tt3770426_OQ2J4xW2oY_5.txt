I'm being kind by saying this is a good portrayal of how immature &amp; self absorbed many young people are nowadays. if this was the aim of the movie- then they did a good job of it- but if not, it was a POOR movie.we all die- whats the big deal about it? whats the need for all this self absorbed drama? esp the guy- he seems to be making a big deal about things that many of us simply take in our stride very frequently. if we had to deal with things the way he does, them we would all be under strong prescription medication. the movie takes itself too seriously, unlike garden State which had humour in it.
