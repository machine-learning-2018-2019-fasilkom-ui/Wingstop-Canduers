I wish someone would make a real documentary about this band. This so-called documentary, that originally ran on CNN, was directed and edited by Peter Pardini, whose uncle Lou Pardini has been a member of Chicago since 2009. Not exactly the independent journalistic standard I'd want from a documentary. It's difficult enough to trust documentaries when they're made by people who are independent from the documentary's subject, but a documentary by a band member's nephew is not a documentary. And they buried the fact that it was made by a band member's nephew. CNN should've known journalistic standards dictate that information be presented right up front in bold letters. Don't get me wrong, it was enjoyable, but it's not trustworthy.
