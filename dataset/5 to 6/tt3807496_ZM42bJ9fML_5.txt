This is a film made by the remaining members of the Chicago. The first half will thrill any Chicago fan, great live performances, the stories behind some iconic Chicago tunes, a wonderful tribute to Terry Kath, but as the movie progresses, the band felt the need to trash most former members. This is a shame because the music they made was special and while the remaining members put on a good live show, the music made since Danny, Peter and Bill left does not live up to the legacy they ALL created! I think it was very classy of Danny to be interviewed but Bill, Peter and JWC have all been conspicuously absent from the band recently and it says a LOT that they refused to participate in the film. Like the band's musical legacy, the first half of the film is a solid 10, the second half, is a lackluster 2.
