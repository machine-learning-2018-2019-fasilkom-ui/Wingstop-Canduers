I'll admit to not having watched Cabin Fever (2002) for quite a few years, but from what i can remember, this is nowhere near as good.The premise is the same as the original being a remake, but just doesn't have the same impact. More gore, and even more stupidity, but these types of movies aren't ever going to be logical.The characters, just cut out clones from every horror film, nothing likable about any of them, so you don't even care when they die. The script is just shocking, seriously the dialogue and the execution of it is just poor. The characters are portrayed as having at least half a brain on their shoulders at the start, but that soon disappears. I'd say the beginning is actually OK, just average though, but once it gets into the main story its just another dumb horror movie.BUT, if you take the film for what it is, its an alright watch. Just a bunch of teens dying in various gory ways (although i can tell there will be an unrated version as some scenes were obviously cut). So if you're into that sort of film, give it a rent. If you want a more intelligent horror, this isn't for you.
