I gave it 5/10 because it's a family friendly film. The language was clean, and there were no innuendos. However, it drug along. Our 13 year old son lost interest after about 30 minutes.Priscilla (the main character) was a teenage girl in New England attending an elite Boarding Academy where Equestrian was a large part of her life. Her mother and her new fiancé announced to Priscilla they were leaving on a 4 month world cruise without Priscilla. She would have to go to Michigan to stay with her father, whom she had not seen since she was 1 year old after her mother left him.She arrives in Michigan cold and distant. Through various circumstances, after her horse arrives from the East Coast, she becomes interested in barrel racing at a local rodeo. The rest of the movie revolves around her quest assimilate and to excel at the sport. This desire brings about conflict and growth with her dad, whom she calls "Duke", and her mother, who makes a devastating decision that could derail all the progress Priscilla has made over the summer.I don't want to say too many bad things about this film, as it was obviously a low-budget production and the producers were trying to make something that was wholesome that the entire family could enjoy. The filming quality and editing were good but the acting was a bit stiff and continuity was almost non-existent.However, despite the flaws, it was still a decent family film.
