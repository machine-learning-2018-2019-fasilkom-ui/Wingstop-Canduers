Mediocre tale , with a laid back low energy vibe. The two leads are an unconvincing match as two fragile people, but somehow it works. Maxwell Schneider plays it real, though I've never encountered a chilled parking enforcement officer who would tolerate being spat on.
Lots of quirky dialogue and introspection and insecurity, sometimes coming over as unscripted or natural dialogue. The long wait for parents to arrive does not work.
