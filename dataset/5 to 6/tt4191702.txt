I don't understand Norman. Was it pride that motivated him? A need for recognition? How did he make a living as a "fixer". I'm not dumb, but the movie makes me feel like I am. The acting was great, the personal relationships were well depicted, multifaceted stories being told were very good. Yet I still need some help to understand Norman.
