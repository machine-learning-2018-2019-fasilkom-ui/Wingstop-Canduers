I don't think Wrecker is the worse out there, I've seen plenty movies with similar plot, I personally think this one did better.Will you watch a masterpiece? No! Will you watch a B horror? Surely enough! If it is a B+ horror or a -, will come down to everyone's opinion, I for one am satisfied cause I've seen a lot worse. I had pretty much no expectations, the poster looks cheap, the plot is overused for its substance, as clearly you can't milk this cow too much, yet it managed to create a little story. With the obvious moves from other far better movies, but it did try the best it could and it managed to present something possibly worth a watch. A watch!Overall, I played it with no expectations and ended up with a Heh instead of a Meh. So, all in all, better than expected I guess.Cheers!
