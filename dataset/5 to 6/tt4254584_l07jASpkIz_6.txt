A gorgeously done look at street life.Kid saves some money to buy the fresh new Jordans to put on his feet other than the holely skips he was wearing, his life already changes from the confidence boost with a new swagger that attracts the girls. It also attracts trouble when the local crazy dude steels his kicks. Now the kid becomes obsessed with taking the slippers he's now force to wear off his feet and getting back his kicks at all cost.I remember this life as a kid and how important Kicks were, and it sucks that Kids still have to worry about having their shoes taken. Then again, those 1st addiction Jordans could help pay someone's rent and put food on the table.At first glace, its a horrible look at the what happens when you introduced Jordans to this culture (it seems to me not coincidence that the movie is about the re editions of the 1st Jordans), but all of that is superficial to the message of what really is important in life.The young acting cast is very good, but I can't help but to give a shout out to Christopher Wallace Jr. not just because I'm a fan of his father Biggie Smalls, but I think it's cool that he's an actor and he's good at it.Overall, kicks gives me that colorful feeling I got when I saw Dope and Dear White People, although it has slightly more of a serious tone to it, and it needs that to get the message across. I like where all three of these films are going and how they are going there. Kicks is worth seeing.
