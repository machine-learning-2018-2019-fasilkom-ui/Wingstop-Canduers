An OK film for kids, this film moves along quickly, but predictably to its inevitable conclusion. 75 minutes is plenty long. This is a film made in Iowa, by a team with 4 other films to their name. It is going directly to video distribution, so I got to see one of the very few theatrical showings. Kids and adults laughed occasionally, partly because of slapstick humor, and they also enjoyed seeing some familiar local sights. It mentioned the need to believe a couple of times, but that wasn't as overbearing as it is in so many other films. The cast varies from competent to amateur. Some music is too loud, but that could have been the theater's sound system. There are no really bad parts, but there's a continuous feeling of "I've seen that before."
