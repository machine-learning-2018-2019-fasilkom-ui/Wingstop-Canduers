A bunch of guys, playing Viking. I guess it's better than playing a Viking on your Xbox, but still rather silly in my book. Let's face it, these guys are accountants, plumbers, doctors etc. They spend a few days surrounded by porta-potties with toilet paper, get plenty of food to eat, drink their bottled water, muck around a bit, then head to the airport in their Hertz rent a car.My guess is they have plenty of aspirin around and of course, are not far from a cell phone tower. Goddess forbid. Nice hobby if you need to prop up your manhood.
