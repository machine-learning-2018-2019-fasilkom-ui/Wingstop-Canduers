Saturday, 19 December 2015There are two movies with the same title "Extraction" for release in 2015. One which stars Bruce "Moonlighting &amp; "Die Hard" Willis and sexy fighter turned actress Gina Carano. The other, a non union low budget full of unknown actors/actresses {actor-director, Tim Kirkpatrick, Caitlin Custer and Iranian-American actress Medalion Rahimi. The latter is set to be on DVD and the i- net later this month.I have seen Bruce in much better action films, especially "Die Hard "1 &amp; 2 and "The Jackal" with the brilliant Sidney Poitier. This movie is as bad as his old movie "Hudson Hawk". The action is predictable as well as the outcome ending. Some guys look good doing fight scenes beating up 5 or 6 guys such as real good martial artist/actors Wesley Snipes and Michael J. White. Even brilliant academy award winner, Denzel Washington's fight scenes in "Equalizer" and brilliant actor, Liam Neeson in all three "Taken" movies fight scenes looked way better than in this movie.Kellan Lutz is not impressive. He is better doing non action films. His fight scene with the Asian man in the warehouse mid way in the film, the Asian man would have beat the hell out of him, but the script was written for Kellan to win. The only reason I am rating it a 5 is because sexy fighter turned actress, Gina Carano is in it. Gina is the saving grace of this movie. Gina is a real good fighter, nice figure, sexy and prettier than her competitor, Ronda Rousey.Please "Extract" this movie from my eye sight.
