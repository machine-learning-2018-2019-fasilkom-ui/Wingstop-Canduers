It's inevitable that a "sequel" has to be compared to the original even if it's about a relatively different theme (actresses versus actors.) "That Guy" was an honest and refreshing look at the life that an actor goes through in the industry both positive and negative without much emphasis on gender issues. Heck, I can't think of a single instance in which what a man might go through as an actor was discussed (for example, how does a male character actor go through periods of unemployment with this dating life in a city where appearance of affluence is everything?) With "That Gal", it was almost entirely about feminist issues. Not to say they aren't valid or useful especially to the context of what women go through in the industry but a lot of the issues are well known by now (cosmetic surgery, ageism, etc.) These are interesting women but sadly hearing them chat across a dinner table like on the View made me fast forward through segments On Demand.Granted, sequels have a problem in the best original material has already been mined for the original so the writers either need to dig deep or go with a new theme and they did the latter. Also missing from the sequel I would have liked was the way in the original they explained "where are they now" about each of the actors at the end. I actually shed a tear for the actor who had passed away between filming and release in the Guy's version.Ironically, the theme of the film that Hollywood is sexist and typecasts women was a flaw precisely with this documentary. Rather than being about women who are actors, it became about stereotypical women's issues as actors. With Guys, I felt like I was getting an inside look into what the actors thought. With Gals, it was like I was getting something they thought the producers might want to hear. Pity.
