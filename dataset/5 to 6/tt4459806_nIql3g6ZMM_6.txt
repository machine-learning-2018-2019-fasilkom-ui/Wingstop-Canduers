I'm a big fan of Wild Eye Releasing, but I didn't see it coming when it came to Dead Love. This is one messed up love story set in the mountains in Colorado. I was expecting vampires or other monsters of the night, but I was fooled! The ending is a total flip and a freaky one at that.Wild Eye is surprisingly well made for a low budget movie. The cinematographer, original music and acting is really good. Also loved seeing Kate Linder. She really steals the show here.I recommend Dead Love for all lovers of the genre who want something fresh and different. Go watch it!
