This film is about the opening of a documentary where the film crew, covering behind the scenes footage of a movie in the making, captures an extreme paranormal event as it happened.Yeah, this ain't that great but I didn't think it was awful. There's not much of a script and the acting is subpar. However, the story has a twist and I can't recall seeing one that is similar. Not say there isn't another film like it. I just can't recall one."The Shinning" seemed to have been an inspiration for some of the scenes but this is nowhere near the same quality. The whole film teeters on a fine line between watchable and unwatchable. In the end it was watchable for me.This is independant, low budget film and it fairs well in that category. If you can handle watching films like that it may very well be worth your time.
