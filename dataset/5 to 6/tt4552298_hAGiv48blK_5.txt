Extremely extended and a diffuse drama. A square narrated history that has enormous potential. A lot of non-verbal and marginal persons occur and give us their opinions. But what about those who could interpret Jens and Elizabeth's story from a different perspective? However the trial shows that the US is a very legally unsafe part of the world, where gnomes like this may engage in law. Just add water.
