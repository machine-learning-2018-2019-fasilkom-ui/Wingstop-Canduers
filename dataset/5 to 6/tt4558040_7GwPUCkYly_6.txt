I did not expect much from this movie. But after watching it I was impressed. It's a simple movie . Not laugh out loud fun but fun enough . It will also remind u of your fond school memories . The film itself had few tweaks but nothing major. The acting was good. Main actors looked their character . But The mother and her boyfriend should have been more aged. I would not want to watch it several times. The dialogues and screenplay was spot on. The fun staffs are not over the top . They were neat, not a sore for the eye. I wouldn't recommend it foe watching many times, But for a first time watch it was time well spent.
