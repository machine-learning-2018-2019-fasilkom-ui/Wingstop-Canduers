Cheesy, cliché, contrived, overdone? Yes, yes, yes, and yes. I know it, but I still loved it. Liked the twist. Loved the quotable quotes. Serious matters addressed, but the comic relief was there. Without Will Smith, I probably would have given this an 8. A 7/10. To me, this is a great film that I would watch many times again. "I thought you couldn't afford therapy anymore." "I can't. It was my Uber driver." "Wait. They have a CSI Cleveland now?" "Be sure to notice the collateral beauty. It is the profound connection to everything." "You lived right, my friend. But you are not dying right." " I realized that I was not feeling love. I had become love." Fascinating to learn the actual statistic that 79% of couples divorce after losing a child. Makes sense. My favorite: "I am love. I am the fabric of life. I am the only 'why'... I was there in her laugh but I am also here now in your pain. Do not try to live without me."
