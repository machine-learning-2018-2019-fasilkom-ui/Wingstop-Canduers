Seems a bit of snobbery in the reviews here about how much they understand the ins and ours of time travel, therefore it's an Amazing film.
well, you don't, you would understand the paradoxical levels in this film are implausible. 
That aside, it IS a movie, it's there to be enjoyed and not scrutinised for everything that is fact, not fiction.
personally I enjoyed the film, though there are loopholes and giant cracks of sci fact, not sci fi, the premise is quite original. I would watch again, it won't win any Oscars or pull up any trees in the advancement of cinema, but it's an enjoyable and thought provoking piece
