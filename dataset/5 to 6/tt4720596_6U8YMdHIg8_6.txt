While grieving the death of her husband Wells (Noah Bean), who committed suicide, Helen (Lyndsy Fonseca) meets his partner Tomas (Glenn Morshower) that asks her blessing to proceed running their company. Helen returns to her work and out of the blue, she has a blackout for several days. She wakes up at home and receives a phone call from herself warning that a man is coming in a BMW to kill her. She flees and goes to the house of her friend Alex (Zach Avery) to ask for help. They head to an isolated cabin that belonged to Helen´s father and soon Helen learns that she had sent herself to the past using a time machine invented by Wells to stop herself from committing a murder. "Curvature" is a low-budget sci-fi film with a promising premise, reasonable development and a senseless commercial conclusion. The screenplay is intriguing but could have been better written since there are scenes absolutely ridiculous that should have been improved. Helen overturns Alex´s truck on the road and nobody comes to see or help. Helen, Alex and Kravitz fight in a hotel room and nobody comes to investigate what is happening. The cameo of Linda Hamilton is deceptive for her fans. The senseless conclusion with Helen receiving a correspondence with a flash memory is terrible. But in general the film is not bad and works on the video. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): Not Available
