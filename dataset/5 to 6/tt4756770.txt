The status quo might say Witchcraft equals bad, but c'mon, this one had fine audio, and pretty good visual quality too, not to mention the actors are a phenomena themselves. There's Sleepy, Emo-Will, Tara, the Evil And Totaly Not Gay Yoga Studio Master, not to mention the comedic duo of Lutz (still female) and Garner (again, after switching to Tom in movie 12).
The retcon still exists, as part of the charm of the experience (starting with Garner/Tom living again).The nudity is not strong with this one, but I'm glad Sleepy Sarah got shown, though after checking her bio I question how much of the acting was director's guidance, because she seems better than this. To the point she might not have to show the flesh.The major problem is though is the ending, which left bad taste after an otherwise hilarious movie.
