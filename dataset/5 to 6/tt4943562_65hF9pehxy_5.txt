Im a little shocked this movies score is as high as it is. The first half seemed like it was filmed by High Schoolers but if you can hang in, the 2nd half makes up for it. This movie does have some good info for beginning peppers if you can get past the poor acting of some of the characters. They really did improve as the movie went along.
