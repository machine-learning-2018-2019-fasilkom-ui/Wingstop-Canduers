Like A Million Ways to Die in the West, Meet the Spartans, and dozens of other campy humor spoofs, this is what I call a college kid movie that anyone with a quirky sense of humor can enjoy. Yes, it's campy. Yes it's silly. Yes it's entertaining, maybe not as much as the ones I listed above, but still fun to watch with your buds.
