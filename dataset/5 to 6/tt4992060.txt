This is not a great movie, yet if you are into the occult and horror in general, you may find something here that will spark something in you. There's nudity and blood in this and of course twists (the last one may be a bit redundant, but I've seen worse).Characters may seem a bit out of touch with reality, but there's always a reason for things happening. If they act according to the world presented in the movie that is of course. Some may compare it to Eyes Wide Shut, yet that would not be fair, it's a different beast (masked orgy being one of the few things these movies have in common). Check it out, if you have a heart for low budget horror
