Enjoyed this movie on an airplane flight, and it's indeed a good flick for a flight. There are several elements going on in this movie, but it's not complex either: the relationship of a single father with his growing son, the relationships of four female co-workers, the pending marriage of one of the co-workers, and various love stories past and present. The scenery (the coast of São Paulo) is delightful and the movie maintains a light but never frivolous tone. The cast is excellent, across the board, from the young 11 year old boy, to his father, to the four female telemarketers. A quite enjoyable though not life changing movie.
