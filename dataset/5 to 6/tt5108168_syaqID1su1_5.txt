After a ten-year quarantine, a military squad is sent to a remote island in the South Pacific, which contains a (supposedly) defunct biological warfare laboratory. Their mission is to acquire vital records, but they have to fight off hordes of zombies to do so. Joey Lawrence plays an officer and Maryse Mizanin a French medic. D.C. Douglas is on hand as the proverbial mad doctor."Isle of the Dead" (2016) is an Asylum flick that energetically gives you what you pay for: An island swarming with zombies and protagonists trying to get out alive. It's low-budget and decidedly comic booky, but enthusiastic and relatively compelling. Maryse is cute in blue cammies.The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area (Terminal Island, San Pedro &amp; Palos Verdes).GRADE: C+
