I was expecting to laugh throughout this film from some reviews I read yet I was surprised at the grip this story had on me. Yes, there are a lot of flaws with the film such as the laughable one-piece characters and some characters lack of ability to cry properly. I also know that some characters were not supposed to be likeable yet I felt that we at least needed someone to root for but I didn't really feel that with this film.
That being said there were some interesting effects used in scenes so props to the make up artists. I also do like the premise compared to another escape room film I watched which went paranormal and it felt rather bizarre.
Overall I'd say give it a watch with an open mind to the partially bad acting and you'll actually have an entertaining time.
