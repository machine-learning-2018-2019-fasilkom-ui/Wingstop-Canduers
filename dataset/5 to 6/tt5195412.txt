Bryan Cranston did a great job as always, but the plot was a little drawn out. Interesting idea for a movie, there isn't much explanation as to why he hid away for so long and why no-one ever checked the attic, but quirky and funny at times. The ending was a little frustrating but overall a decent but not amazing movie.
