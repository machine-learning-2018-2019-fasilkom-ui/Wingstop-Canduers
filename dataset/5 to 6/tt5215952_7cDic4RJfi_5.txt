After reading all the rave reviews I was pretty excited to watch this movie(and because of the excellent previous movies by this director). After 45 minutes I couldn't take it anymore, but since I invested my time in it already, I stupidly kept on watching.It is supposed to be scary, but I did not know if they wanted this to be funny or something. I understand the title, most of the time there is people wailing in this movie, annoyingly loud, and this to have a scary effect. I can keep on going on how bad this movie is compared to the reviews you read here, but then I waste even more time on this garbage.By the way, are the police in Korea all morons, who scream like little children and run away when they see people make scary noises?? It was not even comical to watch
