An epic land fight brings two farm owners and long term adversaries to lock horns over disputed land. The "Texas Blood" it proudly preaches is actually set in Kentucky. It's a hallmark movie and all the hallmarks are there - proud values and heartwarming family scenes, American way of life, moralistic, simplistic storyline, and melodrama. Nevertheless, it is competently produced with a starry cast. It rolls with a convoluted plot which is wrapped up in 5 mins flat at the end.
