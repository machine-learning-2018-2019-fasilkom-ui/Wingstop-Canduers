This documentary is a rather good run down of the tragic events which took place at one of the American Titian II missile silos near Damascus AK. This documentary clearly explains the reasons and the errors made during an maintenance cycle of the missile itself and the subsequent damage and consequences of that event.Unfortunately, this documentary is rather one sided. The main interviews are with ex Air Force personnel that were disciplined for their actions when they felt they should have been rewarded. As one how served in the armed forces, this is difficult to swallow as the two disciplined were rightly disciplined despite the fact they worked very hard and risked their lives to correct the issue. The fact they did so is the reason they were not court marshaled and sent to prison. One was given a rather light punishment of an LOR as he was the individual who caused the accident in the first place. The second was given an Article 15 for breaking the two man rule when dealing with nuclear weapons (he was very lucky he as not given a 20 year prison term for that). While I salute his reasons for going in alone, you just don't do that period. I also salute his courage and gallantry in trying to resolve the problem. Again, this why he did not get prison.All in all, this worth a look. Just remember it is one sided and the there is also an annoying drum beat of the risk of this weapon exploding in a nuclear fashion. Based on physics of these devices, that chance may not be zero but it is also not more than 1% either.
