Single down-on-her-luck Brazilian waxer meets loveable loser video shop owner in Austin, Texas. The main theme is the complexity of modern relationships and the attempts to muddle through. It makes a good fist of it but the story is mainly a cartoon of outlandish situations. What makes it work are the performances which are attractive. The film tends to plod on from one situation to another with some good laughs but without a definite throughline.
