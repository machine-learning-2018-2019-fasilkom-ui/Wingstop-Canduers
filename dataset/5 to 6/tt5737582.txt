I'm a big fan of alex essoe (starry eyes) and she shines once again. i didn't like her husband or the sisters acting. the antagonist was ok.good direction, script, and plot twists left me interested. however, the plot thins out towards the latter half of the movie and i had some definite eye-rolling moments.this movie was a good, slightly higher than average movie
