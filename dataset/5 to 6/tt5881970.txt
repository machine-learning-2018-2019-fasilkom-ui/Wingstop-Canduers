I think this movie was made to be a theater release and for some reason ended up on Lifetime. You can tell because of the bleeped out curse words and sexual content. Although I wish they toned it down a bit, it worked as a Lifetime TV movie. I think this movie was fun and relatable in some areas, but at times went a bit over the top/silly and unrealistic. The struggles with dating and trying to find a meaningful relationship were mostly genuine. I loved the relationship, support, and "keeping it real" between the girlfriends too. It also was good at showing women and men in different stages of their own relationships (dating, married, celibate, etc) and choices, sacrifices each made for love and their own integrity or values. The movie was predictable but the acting was good. There were some fun laugh out loud moments (laughing with you and laughing at you) and some "oooh, girl I've been there" moments, as well as a few cringe-worthy, "would someone really do that?", and "they could have left that out" moments. All in all, this is a cute chick flick you can cozy up to with a glass of wine or tub of ice cream on a night you find yourself dateless and home alone...In My Humble Opinion 6/10 stars. 2/2017
