So this is a direct remake of a Korean thriller that came out a couple of years ago. Unfortunately it doesn't quite live up to the task. Though if you haven't seen the original you will probably be susprised by a couple of things and may be able to add 1 or 2 points to the 6 I gave this. But only until you see the superior original will that hold up.The acting is decent and there are small changes to the original, though none improving on what the original did. I know I've stressed that a couple of times, but I just want to make sure, people know it, before they watch this. It's up to you to go back and revisit the other movie or just go for that one to begin with. I'm pointing in that direction, so you can enjoy the twists and turns with a higher quality overall. This one is overall decent ...
