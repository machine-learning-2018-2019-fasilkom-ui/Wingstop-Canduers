Looks like low budget. OK story but no surprises. It's comedy, so you don't expect serious acting, but even so, acting is only fair.There were some laughs although not anything that breaks you up.Nevertheless, I don't see why so many bottom votes (1 star) or for that matter top votes (10 star). I've seen far, far worse. The director had enough sense not to run anything into the ground.
