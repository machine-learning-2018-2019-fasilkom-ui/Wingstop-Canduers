This movie is worth watching. it depicts the realities of the deadbeat dads of the modern American Man. The whole connotation "Just get your dick wet" and "Toot it and boot it!" Is completely exemplified in this movie.This movie does have a positive reality to it. It shows that some dead beet dads have the ability to turn their lives around, but that's highly ever unlikely, especially in the world that we currently live in.The whole trend of just sleep around like animal is the worse societal trend that has ever happened in the USA history, but who gives a heck! The world does't matter, especially since its the end of the world! Young wild and just screw your life over!
