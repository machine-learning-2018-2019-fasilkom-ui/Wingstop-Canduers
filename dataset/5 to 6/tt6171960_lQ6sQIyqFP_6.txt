I never heard of Todrick Hall until a recent episode of Queer Eye's target mentioned he was his inspiration. Watching this doc, I can see the fascination. By sheer will power, Todrick puts on a show based in part on The Wizard of Oz &amp; his own life, w/the barest of materials &amp; the largest of gumption to get his music &amp; message across. If only someone could bottle up his nerve &amp; 'tude, I think we'd have another source of energy.
