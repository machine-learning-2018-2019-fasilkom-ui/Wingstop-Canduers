Creed 2 (my personal 3 key points):*A boxing movie with 10 minutes of boxing+training and 2 hours of talking and deciding things.*Nearly a copy paste of Rocky 4 and if you thought that that fight was unrealistic, wait for this one.*When Rocky was fighting in his movies even against a Russian I wholeheartedly wanted him to win because he came from nothing, struggled and had spirit. Adonis acts like boxing is his hobby, I just cant feel for him.I cant say more without spoiling... But very weak overall
