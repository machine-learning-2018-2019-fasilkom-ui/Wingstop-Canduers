Spencer Stone and Alek Skarlatos are childhood best friends. Spencer's mom (Judy Greer) and Alek's mom (Jenna Fischer) are single moms. The kids often get in trouble and the principal of the Christian school blames their upbringing. The friends befriend fellow trouble maker Anthony Sadler. Spencer and Alek would join the military. On their leave, they decide on an European vacation with their lifelong buddy Anthony. They are on the train to Paris where they confront a terrorist.The basic problem is that director Clint Eastwood is asking too much from these real life heroes. They are not trained actor and they can't hold the screen. I do like the childhood section which obvious does not have the three real people. It also ties into Spencer's heroism a couple of times. In reality, that's all that's needed. It just needs a couple of more scenes that relate to his impulse to act at that moment. Otherwise, the movie needs more of the initial fight without the three Americans. Quite frankly, the first third of the movie could be getting on the train, first noticing the long bathroom break, and then the struggle up to the point when Spencer peers around the seat. Then it can go back to their childhood and cut back on some of their adult lives to save them from their acting limitations. Eastwood's conviction is bigger than his pragmatism. Greengrass would have smoked this.
