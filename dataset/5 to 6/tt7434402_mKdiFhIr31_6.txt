Wait. It's a horror? Lol! I'm sorry I had to. This obviously micro budget had a plan. They planned to make a movie. They just aren't sure how. Scenes aren't finished, nothing is explained. I have to say, it IS the only movie that shows people doing things that people really would do if a crazy guy came after them.Running into things, hiding in plain sight..things fear make you do. And the killer didn't have super human strength, when people fought back, he looked winded. I laughed out loud a few times. I don't think that was the intent but I appreciate it nonetheless. Biggest chuckle? 21:26.
