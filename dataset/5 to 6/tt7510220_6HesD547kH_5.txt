It is a really a fun thing to watch an adult comedy in theater where people shout, mock and pass comments. This is a new experience for Tamil audience and not really annoying.There are two unwanted songs that aren't musical at all. Some adult scenes are really over exaggerating than to be called enjoyable. The film is okay but it never satisfies it's adult thing. The homosexual comedies are highly annoying and Tamil people who aren't into gay thing make sour faces.Overall, five stars for overall comedy and five stars reduced for annoying comedies.
