My rating stands at 6/10- 2 out of 5 for the 1st half &amp; hour and 4 out of 5 for the last 30 minutes. From no-sense story to hopeless direction the movie has no spark at all. What makes it more worse is the comparison with previous 2 instalments of this masterpiece series. The movie begins with trying hard to tie knots with the story but fails miserably with addition of Sanjay Dutt to the movie. The gangster in previous parts exceeded all our expectations with shady roles but Sanjay Dutt has no dark part or any hidden secret to join Saheb or Biwi in the movie. The director maybe became nervous on handling a commercial actor &amp; thus didn't put his 100% efforts. Jimmy Shergill tried hard but has roughly a screen appearance of 25-30 minutes with no impactful character in the movie. Mahi Gill on other hand has all the focus this time but is led down by poor story &amp; no connection with gangster like previous parts. Chitrangda Singh has no significant character in the story &amp; is just used to fill screen time to increase the duration of movie to 2 hours.The location have been chosen well but cinematography has led down the positives. During movie screenplay also lacks creativity, with poor shot of camera angles &amp; weak dialogues. Music is another led down factor with not even one song to leave with you after the theatre. There is no revenge or no hidden fire in the whole movie. You will be caught in boredom as the movie progresses until the last Half hour shows some potential.Don't expect much from the movie, this part has just been made to take the story further to the 4th instalment in the series. If you have some time to kill or undying loyalty for 'Saheb Biwi Gangster' series than you are more then welcome to ride a journey of setbacks &amp; boredom.
