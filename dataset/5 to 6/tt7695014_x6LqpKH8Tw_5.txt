No storyline &amp; chemistry between characters. Gangster interacted with Saheb when almost 3/4 movie was already finished, he &amp; Saheb didn't had any major problem with each others. Sad to see a brilliant director like Tigmanshu Dhulia couldn't use big stars like Sanjay &amp; Jimmy properly, when he had already made magic with Jimmy &amp; Mahie in SBG1. 
Saheb Biwi aur Gangster 1 = 9/10 
Saheb Biwi aur Gangster 2 = 7/10 
Saheb Biwi aur Gangster 3 = 5/10
