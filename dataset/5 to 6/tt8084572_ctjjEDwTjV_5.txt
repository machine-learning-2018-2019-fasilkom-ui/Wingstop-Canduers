A typical stalking plot. The bad guy falls in love with the doctor who saved him. It wasn't too bad until about 15 minutes from the end. That's when they jumped the shark with the stupid, totally unrealistic conversation between the two of them talking over the computer. And then to rub salt in the wound, she has another conversation with him five minutes later. If it weren't for that, I'd give this a six. But I think I'm being generous giving it a five. I didn't have any complaints with the actors, they were fine. Although Detective Meadows character seems to take her role a little too serious.
