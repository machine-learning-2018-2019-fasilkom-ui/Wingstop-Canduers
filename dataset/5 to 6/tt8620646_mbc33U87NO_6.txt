Stumbled upon this movie wasn't expecting much. Started off eeegh then I heard have fun with my wife ... my ears perked to see what was to come. A lot of twist and turns but some things over the top or left out. Too many NOE WHY IN HELL WOULD YOU DO THAT OR NOT THAT came into play. I watched it thoroughly like I said not bad but not the greatest yet held my attention though.
