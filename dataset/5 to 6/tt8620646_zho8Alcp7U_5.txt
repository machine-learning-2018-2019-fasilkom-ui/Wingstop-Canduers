This is a movie with promising premise but it's not very well scripted. There're many moments you would find yourself questioning the characters intelligence, decisions and actions while watching the movie. I'm not trying to sound smart here, but when I put myself in the characters' shoes, I just find the scenarios too far-fetched. I won't give out too much, but I would say this for example: when someone has a knife in his hand pointing at you with hostility, would you walk towards him?There're so many ways to go at each turning point in the story that could make the movie a masterpiece but I feel the writer only wants to play safe. I give 5 star because the movie kept me interested to the end, although overall it's not very satisfying.
