Liam Neeson delivers as a brooding, hulking ex-cop on a mission. It's always a treat to see Liam command every scene. There's something about his walk - as the director took great aim in capturing. Walking and brooding against fences, walls, and buildings. A determined walk. This movie is a clever and engaging thriller/mystery with a mesmerizing star. Surprising was the metamorphosis of Dan Stevens into a tormented under-world character. Olafir Olafsson also commands every scene as another tormented soul. Brian "Astro" Bradley is compelling as the young teen. What was most intriguing was Eric Nelsen, who evokes disgust at his life choices, yet compassion. He has the face of an angel and yet conveyed torment about his life choices. I liked the movie for a late-summer thriller/murder-mystery stroll into the theaters!
