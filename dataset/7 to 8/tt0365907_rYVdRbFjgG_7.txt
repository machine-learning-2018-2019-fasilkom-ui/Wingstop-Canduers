In 1991, In New York, Matt Scudder (Liam Neeson) is an alcoholic police detective. In 1999, Scudder is retired from the police and is a private investigator without license. When his comrade Peter Kristo (Boyd Holbrook) from the rehab invites him to visit his brother Kenny Kristo (Dan Stevens), who is a drug dealer, Scudder learns that Kenny's wife Ann Carrie Kristo (Razane Jammal) had been abducted and cut into pieces by the kidnappers. Now Kenny wants to find the killer to revenge. Scudder initially refuses the case but then he accepts to investigate. Soon he finds that the killers have murdered other women connected to drug dealers and they get their files from the DEA. When the fourteen year-old daughter of a drug dealer is also kidnapped, Scudder heads up a group to rescue the teenager."A Walk among the Tombstones" is a gloomy crime film developed in slow pace, but with a complex story. The plot is realistic and the viewer follows Scudder investigation. The screenplay does not have a plot point with surprising revelations or action scenes; indeed it is indeed old- fashioned. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Caçada Mortal" ("Deadly Hunt")
