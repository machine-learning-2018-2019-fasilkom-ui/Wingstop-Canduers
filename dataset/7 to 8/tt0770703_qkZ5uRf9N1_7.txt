I don't know why this film was so panned by critics I'm kinda sad I missed out supporting it in theaters. There are so many crappy romantic comedies that hit it big without even a quarter of this films charm (27 dresses, Along Came Polly, etc.) The film centers on a young woman played by surprisingly hot Anna Faris tired of dead end relationships who reads a magazine article and discovers she's slept with almost 20 guys and instead of passing that number decides to re investigate her former loves with the help of her delicious neighbor played by Chris Evans.The movie is cluttered with winning comedic cameos by sexy Joel McHale, Zachary Quinto, Andy Samberg and many more. It moves along endearingly as we tag along on her quest and watch the chemistry blossom between her and her neighbor. It's daily by the numbers but possesses a zesty charm. There are some really funny bits and maybe a stray tear towards the end all making for a fun, entertaining movie which explores a subset of people who may have been a little more active on the love exploring end but deserve happy ending just like everyone else. It's a nice change for the awful goody goody girl stereotypes usually present in these feminism killing comedies. 3.5/5
