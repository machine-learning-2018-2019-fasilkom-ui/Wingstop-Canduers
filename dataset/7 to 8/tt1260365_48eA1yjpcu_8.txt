Well after viewing this only a few minutes ago I'll try to give an outline without being emotionally invested. Great acting from Olivia Wilde and Nick Stahl. The soundtrack was good and the pace was even, as it built the frame around Stahl's character,as to what he actually did or did not do to get him locked in the mental facility. Upon introduction into to Dash Mihok's character Carl, there is an immediate tenseness brought in as they let his evil be well apparent. Of course since O.Wilde is housed in the same facility we can guess there will be some sort of relationship between her and Stahl. Although it wasn't a film with big "thrills" or serious action it did very good keeping my attention, I rarely get emotionally involved but found myself caught up and full of anger at points that I won't mention, I would recommend to anyone, especially those who are looking for some real raw emotion out of a film.Also I need to mention the great job of Pruitt Taylor Vince as he was great as supporting cast. It's freaky how he makes his eyes go back and forth so quickly, I just about blinded myself trying to do it *&gt;)
