..it's not a box-office 'must-see' by any stretch.. but being a fan of both Imogen Poots, and Michael Nyqvist, it pretty much was an easy choice... she's one of those individuals that a decade will add little age to her appearance.. at 27, she has been acting for the past thirteen years, and she'll have a very long career should she so choose.. the story is nothing new, but all the leads, and the entire ensemble for that matter, are well cast, and their portrayals are true.. and there are a couple of scenes where you see just how good at their craft they all are.. it's not one that 'must-be'.. but it can be viewed again with some measure of pleasure
