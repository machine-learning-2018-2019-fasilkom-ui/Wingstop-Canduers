I am a Journey fan, but I am not the biggest fan by any means. This documentary took me by surprise. The story is almost unbelievable at first. It is well produced. It has a nice balance of on stage live music ,one on one interviews, interviews with the whole band, and fan interviews. I have watched it multiple times with different friends, and I enjoyed each viewing. I have honestly never considered hunting down a Journey tour, partly because I didn't realize they were still touring. After watching this I went to Journey's website and checked out their current tour line-up. As of today, there is nothing close enough for me, but i am keeping my eyes peeled. Rock on Journey!
