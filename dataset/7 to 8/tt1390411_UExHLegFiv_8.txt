yes, some movies get released in India even before US/UK. this is one such movie which got released one week before US. I went for the movie more for nature, graphics and 3D of Whale, but as a sweet surprise, the director took more time in depicting characters and their feelings rather than spending time on Whale or graphics, which is a welcome change, considering we having lots of movies with CG now a days.as i said in the summary, it is a movie at the right pace, brooding, dark and desolate at times but nevertheless beautiful.beautiful how the bickering relationship between captain and his first mate changes into a influencing r.ship in the end is lovely. should i say ? must watch.many viewers from IMDb yet to watch this movie, so no spoiler from my side ! enjoy the survival of the fittest and the people who have hope to survive any situation !!swim in the lovely emotions director created
