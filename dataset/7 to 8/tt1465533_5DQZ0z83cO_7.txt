I won't spoil the movie but I will give a few opinions. The story is predictable but still interesting and while it isn't fresh it does have a few things that feel new. It starts off like a detective movie but quickly changes to more of a thriller which is nice. People who gave bad reviews say they couldn't understand why the main character is like she is and makes the movie bad, but I find it easy to understand why she lives like that. Anyone with common sense will see the same thing. The ending is nice too and it is one of those endings where your glad you watched it. Overall I recommend this movie as a rental or a buy when it is 10 bucks or so. Give it a chance and let it develop and the characters acting aren't bad at all as they all played the characters they were suppose too. Give it a whirl and I am sure you will enjoy.
