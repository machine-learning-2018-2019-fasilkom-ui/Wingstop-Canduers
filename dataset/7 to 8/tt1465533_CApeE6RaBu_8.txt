"Well this is Columbus circle sir, nothing seems strange around here." Reclusive multi-millionaire heiress Abigail Clayton (Blair) has been living alone in her apartment for almost 20 years. When her neighbor dies she is upset that new tenants have moved in. When an ugly incident introduces Abigal to her new neighbors the lives of all involved begin to change. I have to say that this is normally the kind of movie that I love. A great cast where all their lives are intertwined with each other in some way. A movie that keeps you guessing at the motives of everyone and just when you think you know what's going on a twist is thrown in. This is another type of movie that to talk about it would give away something that would ruin the enjoyment of it so I will just say that this is a must see movie that you will enjoy. I really did. Overall, a great thriller full of twists that keeps you guessing. I give it an A-.
