While this movie is far from the best movie that I have ever seen I found it surprisingly good. Maybe its because when I rented out this movie I didn't have great expectations. Sure the acting was pretty average, the story line while making sense wasn't the best. The subtly jokes that it pulled at other movies and just the idea of having orcs as the major villains made the movie funny. While it is considerably short I believe they made a wise move of keeping it at that length as the story line didn't drag.So in conclusion it's a good movie as long as you don't over think any of it as it is not a smart movie.
