I was laughing from beginning to ending of ORCS! The dialogue is so well written and witty that I felt like I was watching an instant cult classic. It's not forced camp but dry humor delivered with a straight face which makes these goofball characters and the orcs they are fighting so believable even if they are absurd. The two park rangers reminded me of Cheech and Chong in their early days, sort of at each other's throats but loving each other at the same time. Unlike most horror movies that deliver unlikeable characters getting slaughtered by unoriginal monsters, ORCS! gives us fresh, caring characters fighting against a truly original premise with a climax of a siege reminiscent of Assault on Precinct 13. I enjoyed nearly every minute of ORCS! and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see something funny and original.
