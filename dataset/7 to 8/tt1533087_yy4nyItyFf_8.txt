"Soda Springs" is a Western/Drama about a man looking for redemption and just wanting the chance to proof he can belong again. Right from the start of the film I knew I was in for something special, Eden was a character I immediately attached myself to and no matter what happened in the past I wanted the best for him going forward so I was engaged and set to see it through. Eden isn't the only character in the film that you take notice of right away, every character is well-written and realistic and when you combine that with a terrific story, beautiful landscapes and amazing music you got your self a gem and "Soda Springs" is just that, it's a dramatic triumph. The film tears at your emotions, from happy to sad the film draws you in and never lets up.There's a lot going on in Eden's life after he returns but to talk too much about the details would only ruin the film for those waiting to see it. This is one of those stories that reminds us why we fell in love with cinema in the first place, sadly you don't get to see many films like "Soda Springs" anymore so when one does show up it's not only a surprise but a joy as well.The entire cast did a terrific job, Jay Pickett is incredible was Eden and Tom Skerritt gives a powerful performance as his father in a limited role. I can go right through the cast but instead I will just say everyone is fantastic in their roles. If you like a good drama then I highly recommend picking up one of the best films I have seen so far this year, I am confident it will find a huge audience on DVD with strong word of mouth.Do yourself a favor and make sure you pick this up, you are going to be glad you did. Let me finish by saying Director, Michael Feifer has a talent for telling a good story, my hat goes off to him and I look forward to seeing what he has coming out next.--Patrick Picketts--Videoviews.org
