This was a great movie/story, plenty of twists and turns. There were very low key tricks in the movie that at first I thought they were bad acting or bad editing, but they made sense once the movie ended.The cast was fantastic, the filming was awesome,I could feel a Tarantino vibe. My only complaint was the music it really did not go with a Texas, bad boys / fast car movie. It was more of an annoying type of music in 'eyes wide shut'or Hitchcock type movies.There some music repetitions that made you want to get up and leave if they didn't stop soon. josh Henderson delivered his wicked ways and he is my vote for '50 shades of Gray'. josh is a home town boy and the only reason I went to see this movie that has had no preview. I saw it and chose this movie because of josh and there was not any other drama movies available. Only animation / super hero movies.
