Mark Leeper from the ONLINE FILM CRITICS SOCIETY gives Rushlights a 6 out of 10, compares it to "early Cohen Brothers". While I agree with the Cohen Brothers likeness, my vote stands at a strong 8 out of 10. Rushlights is a solid, at times exceptional thriller. Director Antoni Stutz has a unique, talented eye - you can see right away that an artist is at work. In addition the acting is top-notch, however I think the script is a bit over the top. It'll be very interesting to see what project Stutz picks next, considering Rushlights is his first feature. Over the years, one sees a lot of first timers come and go - in this case, I'm certainly taking notice.Sofia Peterson
