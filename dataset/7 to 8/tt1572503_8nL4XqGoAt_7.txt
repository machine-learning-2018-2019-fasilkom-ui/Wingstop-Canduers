Yes, that famous director of horror B movies must be back because this is certainly his style. Subtract four marks if you don't like Ed Wood movies.The story idea is fine but it takes a while for the undead to arrive and until then there is just regular Robin Hood. The editing is disjointed in places (worse toward the end). The photography is good but there is little or no post-production colour work, you get it as it was shot. Audio wise the voice dubbing is poor while the music is reasonable though a little over blown in places. The special effects are low budget, like everything else, and do not knit in very well.By the end of the film the actors were starting to get the hang of it and the costumes look more realistic after a few weeks real wear and tear. However, they must have run out of money because it doesn't really end, the action stops and there are a couple of scenes stitched on that don't give a satisfactory conclusion.If the director had just said, 'We're making a pantomime here, lets really ham it up,' it would have gone a lot better.
