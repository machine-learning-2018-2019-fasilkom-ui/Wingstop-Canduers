Let me start with the fact that i'm a complete addict of the 'found footage' genre. I love the atmosphere it sets and the feeling of 'reality' it brings in these times of silly CGI. In my opinion (check my history) the scariest thing still is the fact that you can't see what is scaring you. I believe in this as a major 'rule' of making a truly scary movie.Having said that, these days I have the tendency to invert IMDb ratings. Because on so many occasions, I have loved a movie that had extremely low ratings and vice versa. So I never skip a movie simply because of low ratings.This movie was fun to watch! The camera was shaky but it is a found footage movie! Like my title says... What did you expect?! A steadycam operator joining the investigation team?Take a movie for what is is. Do not over analyze it, just enjoy it.I think that the only reason this movie got such low ratings so far is that Sean Stone included his dad Oliver, and that somehow made viewers expect another full metal jacket or platoon.Don't worry Sean! Real movie lovers respect the genre and you did a great job on my opinion.
