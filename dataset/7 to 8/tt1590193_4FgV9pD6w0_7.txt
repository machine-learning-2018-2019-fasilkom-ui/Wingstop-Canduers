Like the movie, usually like anything he is in. It was fast paced and kept you thinking but it always annoys the **** out of me when the staff does not do their homework on a movie. I always love places where they show errors that are not picked up in scenes before the movie is finally printed. My gripe here was the ending where the standoff occurred in Beacon NY with NYPD police in charge. Did noone tell them that NYPD has no standing in that area? Where were the NY state troopers?? Just knitpicking I realize but that is someone's job..
