I've been waiting for this movie for a long time. It is far from stellar execution, but certainly not the worst for a low budget film. The script could be cleaned up a bit. The acting isn't great and a few shots could have used a few more takes to make them more real and believable. Overall, I can't complain about the total experience. The main content of the film should be familiar to absolutely anyone who has been apart of a gay relationship. The reality is that different people are at different stages of coming out given any couple. This puts a strain on the relationship.This movie explores how this can evolve and how both sides are responsible for the problems caused by having a justified unwillingness to compromise on how public the relationship should be. The pacing may feel slow to people used to blockbusters, but it suits the film just right as it lets the relationship develop and breathe at the appropriate speed considering the circumstances.Maybe in today's age this is becoming less of an issue, but any gay couple should easily relate to and find real truth in this unique romance.
