I recently viewed a screener of this film, generously provided by the producers. "Scary Story Slumber Party" is an anthology in the tradition of "Tales From the Crypt" and "Creepshow". The framing device, as the title suggests, involves a group of girls having a slumber party with each attempting to one-up the others' scary stories. This is an enjoyable little film I would recommend to fans of the genre. Some of the shorts worked better than others and, as is the case with many low-to-no budget productions, some of the acting is spotty and uneven. However, this did not hinder my enjoyment of the film. The production values are surprisingly good for a film with such a limited budget; the special effects are adequate and convincing, the cinematography is well done and the shorts are directed with confidence. Fans of extreme gore will not find it here, as this one relies more on atmosphere and storytelling to get the point across. There is a vast amount of talent and potential on the screen here, I look forward to seeing what the filmmakers will bring us next. For fans of independent horror, this one is worth a look.
