Stars : Jackey Hall &amp; Devanny Pinn.Write &amp; Directed by : Jonathan Moody &amp; John Johnson.Amazing cast of pretty people,Really awe struck how lucky the casting was.We don't do spoilers here,But so many vignettes with fast paced good writing &amp; filmic execution.The wraparound to anthology is a slumber party with co-eds telling Scary Stories.Bashed -lead off and title is giveaway.Backstabber – Sometimes text are innocent.The Pledge – First appearance of Devanny Pinn and not the last,Lucky us.Imaginary Fiend – neat idea,executed well.Event Invitation – One of the longer segments ,With great set-ups of suspense. A note most of these entries are like 5 minutes.The Dare – Has the incredible Jackey Hall in it.Unlucky Night – One of our favorites,with a great pay-off at end.Valentines Prey – Just take the flowers.Capture &amp; Kill – Very much a take off of the Duck Dynasty craze and has a great plot and open ended for sequel.Noise Complaint – last entry and perhaps one of the most disturbing for its set up of events unfolding.This reviewer was kind of exhausted after this barrage of icky mini – chillers.
