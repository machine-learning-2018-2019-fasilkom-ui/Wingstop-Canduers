I took a chance and bought this movie without seeing it first and I was not disappointed at all. Each and every one of the stories was unique and did keep you at the edge of your seat. Some with endings not expected and some with ending you'll have to wait to see. I'm assuming they will be picked up again in a sequel. The combination of talent depicted in each story worked well and I would say I liked 90% of what I was watching. There was just enough things to scare you and some things to not only scare you but to give you a little chuckle as well. It was very easy to follow along and it does make you feel as if you in a circle with some of you friends trying to scare the crap out of each other. Great concept and idea and looking forward to finding out some of the endings to a couple stories that just keep you wanting more.. Props.. :)
