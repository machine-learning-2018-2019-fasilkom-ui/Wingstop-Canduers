I picked this up at an event his past weekend and gave it a watch right away. At first I was a little iffy about a film called "Scary Story Slumber Party," but hey films like "Slumber Party Massacre III" have been quite interesting! After watching the film, I was actually very happy with it. Yeah, some shorts were a little better than others, and some performances were better than others. But it really is put together well and a solid effort, I got exactly what I expected it to be. I would definitely recommend it to people who enjoy anthologies like The Collective series and III Slices of Life. This is another good addition to that subgenre of film making.
