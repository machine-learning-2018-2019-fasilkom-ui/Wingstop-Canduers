First let me say I loved this film!Director Korinna Sehringer tells the story with grace, compassion, and humor. For a first-time director, she knocks it out of the park. This wonderful glimpse inside Native American culture is a breath of fresh air and adds poignant nuance to a film that sets it apart from the pack. The acting is effortless by many in the cast. The story is enhanced by the beautiful landscapes of Arizona, making nearly every frame a visual treat. I left the theater with a humbled sense of compassion for my own family, which is not easy to do! Director Korinna Sehringer has a very bright future ahead of hear. I look forward to seeing her next picture.
