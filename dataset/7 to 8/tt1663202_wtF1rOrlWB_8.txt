If this wasn't such a fantastic piece of storytelling, I would be interrupting every three minutes to ask "how the hell did they make that shot?" Even if you know a lot about special effects, this film will have you scratching your head all the time.There are shots that start as close ups, go super wide, half way up a mountain and then close to something else miles away. There are interactions with animals like the bear, shot in a way that defies any cinematographic, animal training, prop, or other trick you can think of.I can't wait to see some sort of "making of" that will allow me to sleep at night when I understand how they did it all. Instead of that jerky, overdone, getting us all motion sick, hand-held camera, there is a wide angle system which sucks you into the action in a way we haven't see before.It doesn't matter if you don't like DiCaprio or dislike "that type" of movies. This is an awesome piece of work, worth watching regardless simply for the technical artistry.
