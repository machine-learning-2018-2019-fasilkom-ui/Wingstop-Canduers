I've read some reviews and to be honest some take this movie WAY TOO FAR and it's not a fair review for what is a really good movie for your family and/or children to really enjoy. As far as some characters that people can "relate to" in a kids movie and making a review comparing them to themselves and their life and how a certain character sends a wrong message is absurd and a little too much. THIS IS A KIDS MOVIE!! It doesn't send any bad messages whatsoever. My 5 year old loves it and I do too really. It's very funny, has good music, characters are unique and colorful. Only thing negative is the darkness in some of the Bergens and that they remind me of the movie Boxtrolls which I couldn't stand. But, they don't ruin the movie at all and I can live with most of them. Anna Kendrick can really sing and I had no idea she had that in her and of course Timberlake was great. I highly recommend this movie! In no way does it deserve anything under a 7/10!
