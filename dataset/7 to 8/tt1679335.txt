Justin Timberlake is a well known singer/songwriter, with his all time hit song being, "Can't Stop the Feeling." His recent appearance in the movie "Trolls" capitalized on that. The movie runs song after song, featuring the mentioned song as the ending notes of joy. I'm fifteen. I think that this wasn't a waste of time and money. I have little brothers. They would watch this movie 10 times if they could. Making my feelings towards the movie above par. As a fan of music, I appreciated the songs that were both featured and played. Justin did a great job working with other artists such as Ariana Grande to come up with the movie's melodic soundtrack. Anna Kendrick definitely sings her handful of the music, with the majority of them being upbeat, live life to the fullest sort of songs. This is great if you enjoy a catchy song that gets stuck in your head throughout the day. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a song played on loop every now and then. This movie was a very predictable movie, with having nearly everything being wrapped in a nice, glitter-filled bow. When the inciting event came around, I could think for one minute and depict how the movie would end. But, I guess it was nice to listen to all the songs whilst my prediction unfolded. I think that if you are a child who is looking for a fairly humorous, childish movie, then "Trolls" is your film. A mom who has children should consider this movie for a fun weekend with the kids. Who knows? Maybe she will have a nice song stuck in her head too. I would suggest this movie for all who would like some laughs and a catchy tune.
