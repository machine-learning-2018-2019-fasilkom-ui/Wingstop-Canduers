I had to create a quick account just to review this movie. It was truly fun. It's standard romantic comedy in a lot of ways with the innocent misunderstandings and the best friend support.Seeing all the sites in Paris and all of the humor about the different cultures and language misunderstandings set it apart from a typical rom/com though and made it hilarious and interesting at the same time. Most of the movie is in English and as an American it is amazing watching the actors switch easily from one language to another.As to reviewer who is criticizing the German acting..I really don't know what he is talking about. I thought the female lead was hilarious and that she could have a career in Hollywood. Who the other Germans are..I don't know. The other leads are french, Italian and English.Watch this movie for the humor and sweetness first and then for the sites of Paris.
