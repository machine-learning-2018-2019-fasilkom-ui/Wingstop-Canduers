I found this movie to be a fun, cheesy rom-com, and I say this as a person who's not usually a fan of rom-coms. I had a lot of fun spending time with these characters, and the plot was different enough that I didn't feel like I was watching the same stupid paint-by-numbers movie that rom-coms generally are.The children were precocious, but not saccharine; the Italian lead could have had a little more emotion in his facial expressions, but otherwise, was a fairly solid lead, and the German fiancée was immensely likable, and made her dilemma - when she found out the truth - to be genuine and relatable. The British best friend was some nice eye-candy, and very likable as well, and the French girl on the bicycle and the womanizing Francois were also a lot of fun. I wouldn't mind hanging out with this bunch of people.Overall, this movie isn't particularly deep, and it won't change your life if you watch it, but it would be a very enjoyable way to while away a rainy afternoon.
