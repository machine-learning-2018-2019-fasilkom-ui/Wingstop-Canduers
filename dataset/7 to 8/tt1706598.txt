I give Every Secret Thing a seven star rating purely based on the fact that I was entertained during the whole movie and that the actors and actresses did a good job. None of the cast can't be blamed for bad acting or whatever. The story keeps you alert for almost the whole movie and that's perfect when it's a crime / mystery. I was a bit disappointed by the ultimate ending but nevertheless it was a good story. You don't figure out the whole plot until the end and that's rare with crime / mystery movies. It probably is not the best crime mystery but certainly not the worst either. I would watch it again in a couple years when I forgot about the story.
