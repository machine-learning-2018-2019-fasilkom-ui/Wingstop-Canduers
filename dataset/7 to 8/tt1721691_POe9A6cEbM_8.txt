If you liked "Clerks", you'll go for this low-budget independent film (I'm certain that writer/director Larry Longstreth is cringing at that comparison if he reads these reviews!) I resisted seeing it at first (I'm likely a generation - or more - older than the target audience) but when I did I was captivated from the start. There are some genuine Coca-Cola-out-the-nose funny parts (be careful when you sip!), besides an actual interesting story.The quality of the acting bests most "Lifetime" movies, as well. You'll get no spoilers, nor a plot outline, from me. I will say that if you are just on either side of thirty, viewing is mandatory! Older viewers who remember that age (fondly or not) may also empathize with "leading man" Ben (played by Longstreth.)Anyone with a wicked sense of humor will certainly get a few side-aches!There is much swearing(too much for me, although it likely represents how people of that age actually speak!) so little ones should perhaps watch Shrek XXXVIII instead.
