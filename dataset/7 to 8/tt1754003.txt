Karen leaves her husband to find herself. She has to panhandle to make ends meet (crying at bus stops is one of her techniques). She makes friends finds a job decides in the end that independence is the biggest thing she is after--turns down a relation to keep it.My problem with the movie is it is a generation or two behind the curve. Bookstores and playwrights went out with the 20th century. These cliché intellectual icons of uber importance in South America need to be updated for age of Amazon and the internet. I don't see how libraries or bookstores pay their way anymore.Also the feminist drumbeat does nothing for me either...having Karen cut her hair as she achieves independence etc...But that said the story is pleasant enough the movie has wonderful real scenes and other than the somewhat anachronistic cliché nature of the icons it is a decent effort.There are so many stupid movies made--this one is fantastic by comparison. With a little tweaking this could have been 10 stars.RECOMMEND
