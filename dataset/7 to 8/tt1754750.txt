If re-watchable is important '3 of a kind' will satisfy again and again. This is a fast paced 'girl gets even' film that holds without being dated. A beautiful lady is charmed away by a smooth talking gangster - 'I'm the man of your dreams'. She becomes his captive and her final revenge, planned in the bath with his ex, is worth waiting for. Sensual, hot strokes abound with a good redeeming climax. The likable stars all perform brilliantly and the pace is suave, the editing &amp; direction is enjoyable. A delight to see Margot Kidder again. This is a feel good evening flick that delivers with a want more. More from this director.
