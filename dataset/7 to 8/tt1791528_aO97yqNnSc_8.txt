The movie itself was not incredible, but the main character was nicely designed, with unpredictable behavior and feelings stronger than they seem. The other characters all had their unique parts, but they were all made so that Doc's personality would stand out. The funny part was its similarity with a film noir, but I do not intend to give spoilers
