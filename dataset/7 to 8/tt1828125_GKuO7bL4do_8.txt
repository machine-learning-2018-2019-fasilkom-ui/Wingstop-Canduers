This little gem was really difficult to find, here in Europe. I just finished to watch and I was pleasantly surprised. It's the kind of drama comedy that feels real, all the characters where well developed without been over the top or just a boring parody. Somehow it reminded me of movie like City Island,The Station Agent, Garden state. Those kind of movie that show us how life can be complicate, sad, strange and funny at the same time.This is the kind of movie that I will be happy to add to my DVD collection but it seems impossible to find in DVD (at least where I live).I just hope that movie like this get more attention, because they deserve it. A really little movie gem: well written, acted and directed.I Highly advice anyone to check this movie out, especially to all little drama comedy lovers.
