A great story and solid performances with flawless special effects, Inhuman resources stands out in the horror genre. The movie is tense with many edge of your seat moments combined with the fear and isolation of the 6 people held against there will. Nicholas Hope is perfectly cast in his role as their demented former office professional turned captor with his character ranging from a calm and professional boss to outright psychopathic and twisted.The story takes twists and turns along the way and it's entertainment that keeps you clued to the screen giving the audience satisfaction for their time. With the movie industry churning out endless no star horror garbage, it's great to come across a film such as this where all the right boxes have been ticked
