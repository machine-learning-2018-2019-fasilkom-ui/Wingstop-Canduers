This film was quite well done and with great special effects by Tom Savini, the movie is really good. The story has some similarities to some of the SAW movies with its kidnap/torture scenes, but thats where the similarities stop as it gets you guessing and thinking that maybe Redd is not the killer. But you can never rule him out after the things he does to his kidnapped victims. Nicholas Hope (who also starred in BAD BOY BUBBY) plays the role of the disgruntled boss very well, you want to hate him but with the underlying fact that he may be innocent, you also want to believe him. So you are torn between what looks like the truth and what could be the a lie. There is a bit of a twist to it but if you look for the clues you can almost work it out before you get to it. But apart from that this is a great little movie. I give it a solid 8 out of 10. Recommended.
