I was lucky enough to see this film on the big screen in March this year at the Australian Film Festival held annually at the wonderful Randwick Ritz in Sydney, Lucky, as it was a sold out session and also lucky as it is a terrific and original entry into what can only be described as tired genre... This film takes you places you have never thought of in the Horror/Comedy/Boy meets Grrrrrl/Detective Story/Office Politics genre films you think you may have seen before... It mixes a new and spunky cast with the very experienced and masterly Nicholas Hope as the terrifying but deeply misunderstood Thomas Reddmann... Clever, intelligent and humorous scripting from Anthony O'Connor and Jonathon Green make it a joy for the actors and audience to revel in... Assured direction from Daniel Krige and incredible special make up effects created and supervised by wizard Tom Savini elevate this tale above the norm... Sure, it's low budget and Indie but every cent seems to have been wisely stretched and spent on the story on the screen...How rare is that these days... Can't wait to get my hands on the Blu-Ray to enjoy it again and to see the extras and the Making Of... Never assume anything in this office from Hell...What's also good about the film is that the truth is never far away... It's a tale very far from parody and knows and loves where it is... When you feel things can't get any worse, it just might... but then... it may not! ...You really are on a mad roller coaster ride but can't quite decide if it's better to stay on or get off...Safety rushes by as you decide... One thing you can be sure of... Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the office typing pool..It Ain't!
