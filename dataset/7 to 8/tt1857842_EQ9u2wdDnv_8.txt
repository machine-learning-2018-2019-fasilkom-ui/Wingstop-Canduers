Surprisingly tight and entertaining little Aussie thriller, ticks all the boxes for the horror genre. Very well made and the story moves along at a good pace and avoids horror movie clichés as much as it can for a low budget inde flick. Pretty scary with some really great scenes will have you watching through your fingers! Good to see a cameo from Tom Savini the master of gore, and some really great performances from the cast. Nic Hope must surely be one of the most under utilised actors around today and he gives a good performance as the maliciously murderous boss from hell. Also stand out performances from Sam Reid and Hayley McIlhenney, make this a very enjoyable way to spend a creepy night on the couch with a box of popcorn which may end up on the floor by the end credits.
