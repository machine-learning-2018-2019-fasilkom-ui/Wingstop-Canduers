For those who have felt chained to their desks in the Cubicle Farm, this ones for you. A Yuppie Yarn of Corporate Headhunters played against a Plot of a convicted Serial Killer and his "rehabilitation" and revenge. This is a Gory Story, Fangoria Films and Fans wouldn't have it any other way. The best part of this Saw and Hostel influenced Movie is that it has its decapitated head in the right place. That is, it does not take itself so pretentiously serious like those other over rated Franchises. It is a lively, colorful Film that is loaded with talent on and off the Screen. The Story gets ever more complex as it moves along and in the end it is rewarding enough to rise above the lesser entries in this Genre. It utilizes its Low-Budget and drains every drop of the lifeblood and gladly and Artistically spreads it across the Screen.
