I'm not a huge fan of horror movies but I decided to watch this one because it just sounded intriguing. So I watched it and I'm glad that I did. This movie is just as described - horror, thriller &amp; comedy(although the comedy is very slight and more "clever" than "ha-ha"). I personally liked it because it was clever, UNIQUE and well-written which is not common in horror movies. This movie has it all for a seemingly low budget movie. The acting is good, the script is good, there's just the right amount of gore, it's believable and it's NOT STUPID. Finally, it's not perfect but it's a lot better than most horror movies out there. Give it a try and if you don't like it then maybe cartoons(films where you don't have to think) are more suited for you.
