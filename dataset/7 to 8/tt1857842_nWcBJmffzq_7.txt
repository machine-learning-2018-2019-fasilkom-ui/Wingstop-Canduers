I just finished watching the movie. It wasn't one of those serious slasher films. Even though I've seen innumerable horror movies, the movie still made me cringe. It is sure to make some of the audience want to cover their eyes during some killing scenes, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The movie was explicit about showing minor yet disturbing enough torture scenes, but seemed to deliberately censor the major ones, which is understandable given the fact that it wasn't meant to be a torture movie. The gore is not over the top and it is only there to contribute to the story progression. It is more of a detective movie, mixed with some joker-type madness, which slightly takes away from the seriousness of the violent scenes, and somehow makes you keep watching even if it makes you uncomfortable. You're going to watch a bunch of people trapped in a single location trying to work their way out. This means much of your time will be spent watching the characters have lengthy conversations with one another in order to solve a murder case. The movie is a mix of detective, torture, and comedy genres. I'm not into comedy movies, but it kind of made this movie more appealing. If it didn't have that funny feeling to it, I might have got bored due to it resembling many other movies of this type. I must say the story is very original and that alone makes this movie worth watching, although I'm pretty sure for most of you out there it's going to be a one-time watch only.
