Dark Circles (2013) I really enjoyed this movie, it started of with bang and some bizarre scene in this movie in good way and they making feel very unsettling.Couple just had new born baby, as they didn't want to raise the Baby in new york, so they to place when its less noise.They moved to house and with their new born baby but baby dose sleep at night all, they seem to feel a sleepy a lot tiny.What liked about this movie both of them see things as one time or another but they put down to not having enough sleep.There were really good chilling moment in this movie and that made feel a little tense, they some really good scarce scenes in this movie what work, may make you jump.I also liked how Paul Soter still keep the creepy thought out the whole movies, even nothing is hap ping in those scenes.This was Paul Soter first horror movie but it not great but it was above average for me..The acting was outstanding from everyone in this movie and Baby is cute! 7 out of 10
