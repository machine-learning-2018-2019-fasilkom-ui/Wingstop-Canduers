Moderate cold humor, moderate social satire, modest interpersonal relationship, and a group of distinctive and very competent young actors... Scene control, makeup, photography, soundtrack are also good - in short, except for less investment, this one The film is doing very well in all aspects.
I really don't know what the current audience expects and has the ability to see from the movie! ?
Of course, when I saw the huge investment and the inferior movie like The Avengers series, they were all scored high by these audiences...
So I don't feel strange.
