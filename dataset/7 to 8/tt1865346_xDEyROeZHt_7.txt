Having seen most every zombie flick there is - from great to good to downright painful to witness, this rates amongst the more pleasant ways to spend time with the undead and those attempting to remain amongst the living.Someone earlier wrote it is like "The Breakfast Club" meets zombie flick, and I cannot come up with a better analogy (partly because I have a raging tooth infection!) If you like zombies and comedy, you'll enjoy this flick. As for its budget, or lack of = didn't notice, didn't care - which makes it an even better film in m y big ol' book of "Seen It..."! Enjoy!!!!!
