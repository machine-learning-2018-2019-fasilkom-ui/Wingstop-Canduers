I started to watch this film not really knowing what I was going into, I had watched the trailer and it looked good, but I didn't expect all the twists!Samuel L Jackson is one of my favourite actors and he definitely delivers in this film, as do the rest of the actors.It may not be everyone's cup of tea but I thoroughly enjoyed it, and if you like films of this genre then you should enjoy it too. There were a few bits of the film that I guess weren't explored far enough (for me anyway, I pay too much attention to detail perhaps) but all in all I enjoyed it enough to want to watch it again sometime in the future.
