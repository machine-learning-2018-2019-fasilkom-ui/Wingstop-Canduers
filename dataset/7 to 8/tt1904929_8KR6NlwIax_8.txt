Nevertheless, in the midst of corruption, in the midst of employers who do not pay workers, lawyers (Zingaretti) who cheat honest people pretending to be professionals with a strong moral character, in the midst of people who are willing to money, almost forced, to circumvent girls, in the middle of the junk videos on you-tube and immorality rampant in our countries, a boy and a singular adult (Battiston) go in search of a stork that has been lost, a family man (Mastandrea) in the midst of all his lodges single father, helped in this by the ghost of his dead wife (Gerini) falls in love with an artist distracted (Rohrwacher), cheated and underpaid, forced to live to overturn his art. Good movie to see, in the usual style of Soldini, full of quotations from great writers and artists, along with "anonymous Persian", among them: "Calm is a cowardly soul" of Tolstoy And the final quote, which closes the film, the aforementioned alleged anonymous Persian: "the best thing we can do now is to keep silent." RATING: 8
