When I heard about Fredianelli doing a vampire movie, I knew it wasn't gonna be no TWILIGHT (despite the box-art's similar look and feel). What we get is a decent enough, if over-the-top drama. Sure there are vampires and supernatural stuff and what-not, but some of it just seems a little far-fetched/unrealistic for my tastes (for instance a therapist that swears and takes swigs of alcohol in front of his patients of whom he willingly takes appointments from at his rather up-scale home). Still, the film is grounded enough in reality (a lot of similar head-scratching or implausible moments can be blamed on budget constraints) and the film deals with the subject of vampires in a unique enough and un-glamorized fashion. At times the movie even openly references and mocks vampire movies (TWILIGHT included) in a way that seems clever and fresh.Technically, the film is well put together and boasts great cinematography (even if the vignette effects appears a little overused) and good music score. Performances are somewhat of a mixed bag with some of the more minor actresses coming off as really in-genuine. Most of the leads do OK, but Ray Medved and Michael Fredianelli shine in their interactions together. I see a bright future for newcomer Diesel who excels as Yasha the fortune teller's bright ward.Overall, APOCRYPHA is a well made indie and a decent enough take on the vampire genre.
