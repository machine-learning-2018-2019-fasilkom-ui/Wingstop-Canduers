it is a good film. good acting, good directing, good story, good music... it's not the best i've seen recently (i just saw 'the hunt' from thomas vinterberg and that blew me off completely), but it is worth watching.movie will keep you engaged all the way.i didn't like the ending, but i guess any other ending wouldn't fit, so i shouldn't complain too much.i gave it 8 out of 10 stars, because every single element of a movie (from music to production to directing to...) is real good. considering many mediocre (at best! :) ) movies that we see so often, i would say that this movie deserves to be seen.it's pleasing to the eye, it's soothing in some way... i don't regret seeing it.
