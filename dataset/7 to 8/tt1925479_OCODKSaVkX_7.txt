I have always liked Stephen Dorff, but most of his roles have been strong supporting ones. It is pleasant to notify that last years have seen him becoming a leading actor where he virtually fills out a movie (apart from Officer Down, in Brake last year - recommended as well). He can be both a convincing tough cop and a caring family man, a reliable person and a controversial one. As for Officer Down, he (as Detective David Callahan) as well as James Woods (as Captain Verona) provide the biggest value to the movie (the other actors seem to derive from Seagal-Lundgren type of movies). Woods is also an actor who makes movies more interesting to follow.The plot is slightly cloddish, flashbacks and odd alterations are confusing and some scenes are questionable, especially Logue-related ones. The ending could have been more elaborated, too. Nevertheless, the movie is recommended for killing time and a bit longer than 1,5 hours passes without yawns and/or blah feelings.
