Deep in Characters this is quite an Engaging, but Bleak and Cold, look at another Tortured Cop who seeks a Second Chance. It is a Rich Story-Line that Requires the Viewer to pay Attention with Twists and Turns and multiple Flashbacks.It has a Crisp and Clear Look and the Performances are (except for the ever intense and intemperate Dorff) Stiff, but Credible. Police Cover-Ups and Stripper's Uncovered are Nothing New but this, based on a True Case, Fine at a Bad Cop Gone Good Story.This Barely Released Movie is Worth a Watch for its Rich and Layered Production that Demands some Respect Despite some Indifference from the Money-Men and Critics.
