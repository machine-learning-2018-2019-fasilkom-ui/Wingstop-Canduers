I think it's fair to say that the vast majority of people like a suspense movie, and just as many people like a movie with a twist... And this has both!From the beginning and throughout the movie kept me on the edge of my seat, constantly making me question what was the truth and what was fiction. The actors make it seem oh so real. The plot has a twist and leaves you thinking "that was genius" (if not ever so slightly far-fetched!).It's disappointing that this isn't more popular as it's actually one of the best films I've seen in a while.Superb acting and a great story line, get it watched!
