Hello, This movie had some very interesting plot twists that I did not expect. It twists and then it twists again, which I found very cool. I'm being super vague since I'm not allowed to reveal anything here, but you will be pleasantly surprised when you watch it. It keeps you on your toes! The soundtrack was very cool for the most part. There were a couple tracks that seemed a bit off, but for the most part they were really well placed and well thought out tracks for the scenes. The acting was pretty good and I was impressed. The plot speaks a lot to situations that we all face in real life that seem to get thicker and heavier and harder to deal with, when we least expect it.
