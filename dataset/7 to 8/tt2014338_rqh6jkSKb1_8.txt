Sadly, as a person who has been a part of the filmmaking process for a long time, a lot of what was discussed - the end of celluloid, and the watching of movies on phones, is true. However, the bright side for me, is that there appears to be two schools now for film appreciation. There are twice as many people in the world now as there was in the 50's. people obviously still want to watch films-stories of US. There will always be a place for quality that is best viewed on a big screen in a room bigger than the living room. Humans sharing an experience with other humans, watching a story made well, hopefully , won't disappear. There has been a lot of growth and accessibility for 'pop' film...reality shows etc. That's fine. Change is good, I welcome it. A problem with digital is that product is made too much by ONE person. The great thing with film is that the product like a symphony contains input by a lot of people. Digital pictures are often too narrow and predictable since the technology allows one person to have so much say in the result
