The film goes in to quite a lot of technical detail about the technology of filmmaking; most was easy to follow, but I can see how it might put a few off. Some very interesting questions are posed; particularly revealing are the comments on the fad for 3D; something the studios seem to love at the moment. The music wasn't all it might have been as well; it sounded a little like I was watching an 80's infomercial about a film camera company at times. A well balanced piece although I did find it was beginning to drag a little towards the end. Still, well worth a look for any fan of the movies, I can't see it having a much broader appeal though. On a personal note; I don't really care what technology is used to make a film; to me the important thing is the story. Without a well scripted story, to my mind at least, there's no point in even starting.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.2/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.
