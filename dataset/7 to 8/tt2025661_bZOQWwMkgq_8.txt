Something for everyone. Shadow Witness is a paranormal detective-thriller that won't traumatize your kids. Older film-watchers will appreciate solid performances by veteran actors Batinkoff, Snell, Sorbo, and Hendrix as a team of detectives trying to solve a series of murders. Star Trek fans will enjoy Ethan Phillips as the quirky medical examiner. Shadow costars a believable 12 year-old, Cat Tebo, whose first feature-length film, Barbie, won first place at the 2012 Giffoni International Film Festival in Italy. We are also treated to a sneak preview of international beauty Meta Golding, recently cast in the next installment of the Hunger Games. Shadow Witness credibly explores the normal film repertoire of crime and murder, doing so within a paranormal milieu, and somehow retains its rating of PG -- something the whole family can enjoy.
