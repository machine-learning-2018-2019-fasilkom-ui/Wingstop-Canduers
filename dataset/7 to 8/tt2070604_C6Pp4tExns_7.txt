Do you like TWD? Than you believe in slow mediocre and fatalism but DO you like Z Nation? if you like Z Nation than watch it. It's like ZN which is by far more fun, more realistic as far as survival and hell less depressing.One reviewer (sizzling sausage or something) said the main character in this movie was basically to unbelievable as a master zombie killer and wanted him to die a slow death.... As do I for Rick and his cowboy hat wearing son. Only real folks will live this one out. You have no idea what "character" in film means.The problem with all the young ones is they believe this genre was created by AMC. It WASN'T and us "elders" have been watching Z movies since the 60's. Funny, stupid, horrible, dramatic and the best... all those put together. You all want to be judges of what's a "real" Z flick or show but the funny thing is you'll be the 1st to go when they come because of Pokemon Go...
