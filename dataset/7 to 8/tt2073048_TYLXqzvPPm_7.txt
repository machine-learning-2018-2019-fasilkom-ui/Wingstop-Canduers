I rented this because I'm a giant Sturgill Simpson fan and will watch and listen to anything the man is involved in. Sturgill is incredible here in his debut acting appearance. His performance is better than a lot of Hollywood actors and he plays a villain perfectly. The movie itself is actually surprisingly good for a no budget independent film. The two leads are pretty decent actors and the music is amazing. The writing is very funny at times and it made me think about why I was laughing at what was said. It's well worth the .99 cents to rent on Amazon.
