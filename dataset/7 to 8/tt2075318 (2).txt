This was a real joy to watch. It's light, funny and witty. The story is very simple and most of it takes place in a car stuck in heavy traffic and yet it never gets boring. The characters are both well written and charming and the dialogue is great. Both lead actors did a really good job and made their characters really believable, the chemistry between them is great too.It would be great if films like this would get more promotion and wider release so even more people could enjoy them.If you are looking for something relaxing, smart or a nice date movie, this is your choice.
