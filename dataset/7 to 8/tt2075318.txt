I wasn't too sure about this, but it piqued my interest somewhat, So I took it out. When it opened with some really bad girly girl music, I was like 'oh god, this was a mistake'. But then it got better , and thank f*** so did the music. What I really took from this movie was how my fondness for each character gradually developed by seeing him/her through the eyes of the other character - And it was like a vicarious light-bulb moment you share with them when they start to realise; 'hang on a sec we're actually very compatible'. I can't, off hand, think of another movie that does this so effectively.So it doesn't posses that same sleeper indie understated cool that 'Before Sunrise' does. But there's something about these two characters that make them seem more real, honest and relatable. I guess this juxtaposition between the two films (where this one could so easily have been called 'After Sunrise'), is the movie's whole point.I don't know, but an average rating of 5.7 just doesn't seem fair for a beautifully written script with such excellent dialogue. Well done to everyone involved
