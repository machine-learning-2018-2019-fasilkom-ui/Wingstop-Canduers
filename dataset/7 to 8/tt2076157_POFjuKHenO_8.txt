For the first time since the classic AT documentary film 'Circle of Dreams' came out in 1993, there is another remarkable film of a group thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail. This honest, transparent narrative of the 'Traveling Circus' made up of Monkey, Ringleader, and Lightning will appeal to those thousands of high school, college and postgraduates who are dreaming of doing the Appalachian Trail. It also will appeal to those thousands of former thru-hikers who hiked the trail when they were young.It is an emotional, reality-based story of three 20-somethings on the career fast-track who want to take a break from their traditional education to find out important lessons that aren't taught in the classroom. On their 2010 northbound thru-hike, they learn things they weren't expecting and they weren't all pleasant ones. Some scenes are of joyous group fun and fellowship; some scenes jolt the audience with a display of raw feelings of anger, loneliness, frustration and betrayal; and, some scenes reflect the inspiring wisdom gained from this 'pilgrimage' or 'walkabout'. If this film is in your neighborhood, I recommend that you see it. It is honest. It is entertaining. It is thought-provoking. And, it is beauty and the dirt.Warren Doyle PhD Founder/Director - Appalachian Folk School 16 traverses of the AT (34,000+ miles) ALDHA Founder and Honorary Life Member; ATC LIfe Member
