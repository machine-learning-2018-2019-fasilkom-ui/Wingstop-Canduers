The story is about men in Rwanda who where children when their country erupted in a horrible civil war and how they found some purpose in their lives through cycling. One man lost sixty members of his family to the killings. "Six zero" he emphasized. You get to meet these men and their families, the culture is presented and contrasted to western values and economies. Their mentor explained how he provided money to support a diet suitable for a athlete in training but it was spent to support an extended family. You see their success and the pressures that come with it. The camera work and locations are great, you see the beauty and can also feel the grit. Anyone who has fixed a flat tire on a remote trail will get it. In the extras,producer T.C Johnstone comes across as just a arrogant and rude man; We're filming here, can you shut up. Hey, get these locals out of my shot! This is my new friend, spoken in the most condescending tone one will ever hear. His entire commentary is about him. He had problems at the airport, etc. A boor.
