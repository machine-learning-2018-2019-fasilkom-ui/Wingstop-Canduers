I mistakenly looked at this movie thining it was ALL Hollow's Eve, which came out the same year, and was saddened by how low budget it LOOKED!But then I recognized a girl from the Hatchet series, the best original horror series movie wise, made past 2000. And then some stupid stuff at the beginning, some more terrible acting, and some amazingly stupid plot.All the above added up to a very stupid horror movie, but fun. Funny lines, scenarios and oh yes....sexy girls and sex appeal.Bad movies are fun. As long as they have a good pace, can be enjoyable.
