This is my first review and i really had to write it after just coming back from watching Pixels.I'm not going to really talk about the movie, the premise is simple, its just a show about the old arcade games attacking the world. Is it fun? Hell yeah it is. Is it funny? Yep, sure is, is it really really funny? Not really, but are there really really funny shows out there anymore? NopeIs it worth your money? Yes it is. So look here, the show is about ARCADE GAMES ATTACKING THE WORLD, so why take things so seriously? The people who slam this movie are going on and on about acting, the show being not funny, lame jokes, Adam Sandler trying to make moneyPlease..who makes movies not to earn money? Look at yourselves, if you didn't enjoy yourself at this movie, you probably are taking life or yourselves too seriously. The ratings are low because people enjoy arty farty movies too much? Or they are trying to show that they are sophisticated? Movies are supposed to be fun and this one sure is. Looking at the ratings at rotten tomatoes epitomizes the way people think nowadays, all uptight, trying to find a perfect movie and just plain wet blankets.
