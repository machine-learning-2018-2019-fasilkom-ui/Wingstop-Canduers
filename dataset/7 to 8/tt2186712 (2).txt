It's very possible that many people will not relate to this movie but having lived a similar life in the past I can say that this one really hit close to home. It brilliantly captured the lifestyle and the feelings between various singles in NYC, with a very heavy emphasis on the man's point of view. Shiloh Fernandez being the man in this case, a role that he absolutely nailed.The movie was just very well done overall. It could have been cheesy but instead had a sophisticated Indy feel and swiftly moved through the many different situations and relationships.A very interesting part of the film is a not-so-subtle reference to 'Women', a 1978 novel written by Charles Bukowski. I'm only guessing here but it seemed pretty evident that writer Chadd Harbold was heavily influenced by this novel, and if that was the case he certainly did the novel justice. I'll certainly be checking out some of Harbold's other works.Don't be discouraged by the low IMDb rating. This one is much better than the 5.5 it had at the time of this review and definitely worth the watch.
