This is a good film that I suspect will live on as one of the most accurate depictions of what dating is like for millennials, particularly young men. Raw and brutal at times, soft and tender at others, it will speak directly to the heart of a certain kind of audience, therefore it is not for everyone.Side note: how is Helen Rogers not a star yet??
