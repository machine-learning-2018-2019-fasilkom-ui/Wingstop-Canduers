The director, Vamsi, is only a few movies old, but the manner in which he introduces the characters and puts forth the story is commendable. Yevadu is an out and out entertainer and doesn't let the mass enthusiasts down.Just like any revenge drama, the movie involves the protagonist's loved one being killed and how the hero in turn gets his revenge. But the part in between the entire drama is what makes Yevadu special. The story is very fresh but the mass elements give it a jaded approach. The story has twists but quiet a few of them are easily predictable.Acting wise Ram Charan was good, his body language and emotions were spot on. And yes his dance moves were good but not very extraordinary. And one draw back of Ram Charan is his hair style, its been the same since Racha and he has to try out new styles. Kajal came and went doing what was needed of her. Amy Jackson's role was not chalked out well and her part might have not been required, she seems to have an overdose of make up. But in her song with Ram Charan, she gives the viewers a generous display of her voluptuousness and looked ravishing in that song. Shruti Haasan's role was not powerful enough but made her presence felt in the form of songs. Veteran Jayasudha gets a brilliant character loaded with powerful dialogues. The others did their part as required.Though Yevadu might have subtle similarities with Rajamouli's movies, it still has all the elements that a movie needs to become a hit. But there have been loads of such movies, but its the story that deserves a mention.
