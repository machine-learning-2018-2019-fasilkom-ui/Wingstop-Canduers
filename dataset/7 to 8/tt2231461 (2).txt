A lot better than expected. And on IMAX 3D this was a winner.Recommended!I hate trailers, and tried to watch the trailer after I watched the movie.. well, it shows EVERYTHING! 
If you want to see the movie without knowing what's going to happen, do NOT see the trailer.I'm not sure why the trailers are so long and so revealing.
They ruin everything for me. And in cinemas I have to watch a whole bunch of them!
