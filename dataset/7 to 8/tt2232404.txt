This has all of the trappings of a great independent film, a solid Hollywood drama, beautiful actress, and broken family. This isn't a big budget production, but it is a solid story. I learned a lot about Jayne Mansfield's life and where she came from. If you like independent films, then I think you will enjoy this movie.
