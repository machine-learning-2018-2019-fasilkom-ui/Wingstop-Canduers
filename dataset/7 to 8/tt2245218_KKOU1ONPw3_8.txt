Monsters Wanted covers the subject of the hunted house industry thoroughly. I had no idea it was as big as it was on this independent level. Some aspects of this movie were based on bold decisions to make keeping the best content the top priority. One man's face is blurred out and his voice is distorted. As you watch the movie the reason for this is clear and only adds to the impact of what is going on. Some filmmakers would have cut this person out of the documentary, I am glad they did not. The most interesting thing that occurred to me was that in many ways the process of gearing up for the haunted attraction and then operating it was similar to film production. This documentary also had high production value. So I recommend that you answer the call for Monsters Wanted.<ul><li>Review by Curt Wiser, Writer-Director of Web-Cam (AKA Cam-Girl)</li></ul>
