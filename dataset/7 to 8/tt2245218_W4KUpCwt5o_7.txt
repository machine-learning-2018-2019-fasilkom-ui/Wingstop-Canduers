Entertaining behind the scenes documentary on Asylum Haunted Scream Park. The site is a sprawling 40 acres outside Louisville, with four dedicated horror areas. Doc follows Rich and Janel, a well adjusted enough couple, and their labors to get everything in place before opening day. Surprise visits by inspectors, backstabbing rival horror parks, rain and more rain, temperamental actors - including one who seems borderline certifiable, complaining business partners, equipment malfunctions, running out of money, as the opening deadline shrinks from months to weeks to days to hours. You wonder how they can possibly get it done. Will hold your interest from start to finish, might even plant the urge to get out Halloween night. For anyone who is a repeat customer of haunted parks, for anyone who ever worked a Midnight Mansion, for anyone who took a stab creating their own Death House*, this film ought to be in your queue.
