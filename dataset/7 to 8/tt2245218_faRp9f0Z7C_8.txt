I love documentaries, this one especially because I'm from Louisville &amp; I support anything that makes Louisville more of a major city. Events like Fandom Fest (where the movie was first shown), building places like the KFC Yum center &amp; even much smaller things like local Halloween haunted houses, all work together to create a wonderful city. Without giving anything about the movie away, it's a documentary that capture's a moment in peoples life's, where they say 'enough is enough, I'm all in". It's not scary, except for their money issue, there isn't anything haunting them or spooky ghosts in the woods. Well worth a watch, especially from people that live in LOUISVILLE. You gotta support your city, or your hurting it, by just standing around.
