Before I go forward with this review I feel I must point out that I am not a big fan, nor follower, of Holloween or Horrer culture. Also I am not the biggest fan of documentaries. With that being said this was actually a very good film. I seen it at the world premiere held at fandom fest in Louisville Ky. I found myself submerged in the people drama, as well as being very intrigued with the underground culture that surrounds me. Between the nail biting deadlines that the characters were trying to make and the education I was receiving in the world of haunted houses, this film very much caught my attention. It was funny, dramatic and even through all the blood, guts and gore, when it was all said and done managed to be heartwarming. I really enjoyed this film and have already recommend it to friends.
