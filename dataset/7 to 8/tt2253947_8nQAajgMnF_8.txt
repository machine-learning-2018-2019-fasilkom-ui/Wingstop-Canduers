I can't give this a proper review as it's been about 5 years since I've seen it (once), and as far as I know it is unobtainium on home video. The film (best as I can recall) bounces around through a bunch of seemingly unrelated quirky scenes and characters, with perhaps for some, only it's wonderfully bizarre animation to keep you interested. Just about the time you wonder where the hell this mess is all going, and if you should stick with it, things start coming together in amazing ways. It's a rich piece of storytelling. While watching I had the feeling I'd experienced this style before. Afterwards during Q&amp;A, Chris Sullivan gave a shout-out to Joe Frank in the audience - that's when it hit me how much this film is like a Joe Frank radio play.Anyway, this is "not for everybody" but if you like well crafted stories in the style of of a Joe Frank production, you should give this a shot. IF you can find it.
