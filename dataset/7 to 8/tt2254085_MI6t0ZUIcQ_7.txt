A very heartfelt and sincere presentation of an entire community of people drawn together by lawnmower racing (the comic value never gets old as they run to mount their machines) and the desire to help those suffering from Huntingdons Disease. Like the best kind of documentary, it steps out of the way and lets the people impacted by the disease and those engaged in the sport take the spotlight. This results in some very funny moments and when examining the full scope of one family's impact from HD, some very sad scenes that left me impressed with the strength of character that these people display. And they seem completely unaware of the camera, again making it a transparent way to tell a story. Effective use of some great independent music through the entire film adds to the appeal, especially on the racing scenes. If this comes your way, make time for it.
