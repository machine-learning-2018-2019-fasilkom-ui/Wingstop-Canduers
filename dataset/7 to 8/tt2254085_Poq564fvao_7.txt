On your mark,get set, mow is a very well made documentary. I really liked this movie. I highly recommend it. It is very entertaining. I laughed out loud a couple of times. There was some great action footage of lawnmower races (wrecks and all).And I actually learned a few things about behind the scenes of lawnmower racing, and Huntingtons, two things I knew nothing about before this film.There are interviews with politicians where you see how and why certain bills are introduced in congress. Interviews of medical experts, some with their own personal stories. And an interview of the great Arlo Guthrie.
