When I first heard about this movie I thought it might be silly, or absurd, or snarky, none of which is true. OK, perhaps there is an element of the absurd. But film maker Mike Ratel uses a sympathetic and insightful treatment of multiple layers of subject matter to give the viewer to a truly engaging introduction to a dual universe they may only have been peripherally aware of – the intersection of lawn mower racing and Huntington's Disease. I thought it was hilarious, poignant, and entertaining.The sound track is well matched to the pacing and editing, and the interviews range from humorous to profound. I did not anticipate such an emotional response from such a seemingly trivial and ridiculous subject - Lawn Mower Racing.
