Love is All you Need is geared for an open and educated audience. I think it is a brilliant idea to reverse the world we are living in to showcase a problem of the LGBT community. The intensity of the movie took me by surprise and the acting is brilliant. It is easier after watching "Love is all you need" to get a better understanding for the trauma that bullying creates in the life of gays and lesbians. I especially like how society and religion played their cruel supporting part. It is a monumental task to take on such a difficult but relevant subject. My congratulations go to all involved in this piece of art. I would think people that see Woody Allen's movies would enjoy this one.
