Anna Shields served this film as screenwriter, co-director, co-producer and star, and damn is she ever terrific as the suffer-no-fools title character, a porn shop video clerk clad from head-to-toe in fetishwear and attitude. Leigh Strimbeck provides impressive support as the mother who drives "Peep" to work and back, always certain to have her car stereo tuned to STD-tips talk radio. Though shot on a modest budget, co-director/producer, Jon Russell Cring, with well over a dozen previous films under his belt, knows how to make a little look like polished gold. And I'm actually shocked to read here that the film runs 78 minutes, as it truly felt like barely half that.
