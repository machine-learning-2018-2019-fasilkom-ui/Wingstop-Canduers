I liked this film. I admit, I am a Dave DeCoteau fan, although I had not seen one of his films in a long time. His films are not for everyone. He has single-handedly created a niche market for homo-erotic horror, and has done it very well. This film looks great. The location is astounding, and is a character in itself. The men are gorgeous (of course) although only one of them, Preston Davis, is a professional actor. Some of the others are quite good (Quincy Ndekwe and Jerrell Pippins); others not so much (no names, please). I doubt the budget was anywhere near what IMDb says it is, but the film does look great. I suspect a hefty part of the budget when to hair and make-up for Trina Parks, gowns for Miss Parks, stylist for Miss Parks. She's the only one besides Preston Davis who gets to wear any clothes. The "plot" of the film could fill a running time of 5 minutes, but that's the not the point of a DeCoteau film. DeCoteau is very good at what he does, and this movie doesn't disappoint. Sure, some of the action happens off-screen and the middle is a little slow, but I would watch it again. Note to the director: there is a reason why Miss Parks hasn't done a picture in 36 years. What next? A vehicle for "Bambi?"
