Noir film, brilliantly acted by Ben Foster, who deserves to be a major star. Familiar premise of a hitman who rescues a teenage prostitute and goes on the lam with her and her young daughter. Somewhat overacted by Elle Fanning, who needed to rein in the histrionics - a mistake by the director.. The story holds up well, with twists and turns along the way. Unfortunately the ending lets the whole thing down. Illogical and rushed (as other reviewers have noted!) the story simply peters out instead of ending with a bang. A shame as there was enough good acting and originality to the story to have made it a good watch. Interesting to note that Wikipedia reports the write took his name of the credits when the director made changes he disagreed with. Would have been nice to have seen the original ending instead of the director's.
