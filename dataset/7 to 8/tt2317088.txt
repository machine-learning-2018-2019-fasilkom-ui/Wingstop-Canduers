As a football fan (yes it's called football and not soccer as you kick the ball with your feet, not like American football where you throw the ball with your hands so that doesn't make any sense) I enjoyed this documentary/biography. I'm a Standard de Liège fan, a hardcore fan, so I know what it is to feel the bond with your team and/or city. But most importantly when you're with likeminded every week is the feeling of belonging to one big family, through the good and the bad moments. You have to be in that particular movement to know that feeling. So it's nice to see a story like The Sons Of Ben, a story about devoted people never giving up on their dreams of having a team they can follow and love unconditionally, a team in the city they live, the city they love. But only in America is such a thing possible, buying yourself immediately in the highest competition without ever having to progress from the lower leagues. Money can achieve anything over there, and that to me just doesn't feel right. In any other competition in other countries you start from the bottom leagues and promotion to higher leagues is only possible by being champions in the lower leagues. But that aside Sons Of Ben is a nice story, even for people that are not into football. Football is passion, and even if it's all about business and money now, you'll never take that passion away from fans. Football is not sitting down, eating your hamburgers and drinking your big cups of coke, football is standing up, yelling and singing for your team, from the first second till the final whistle, it's hating the other teams and fans even if that sounds bad. You have to be a fan to understand that.
