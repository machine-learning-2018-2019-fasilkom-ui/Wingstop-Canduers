I was really looking forward to our family watching this movie together for Christmas. Several years ago I had come across a touching story called "A Christmas Orange." As soon as I saw this movie playing on cable, and read the synopsis, I knew it must be derived from that same short story that I had read. The basic meaning of the movie is the same as Fred C Lemon's short story, although there was a big difference in that the main character of the written story was a mischievous orphan boy named Jack, and in this movie, the main character is a sweet orphan girl named Rose. Rose being left at an orphanage as a baby is a kind-hearted, responsible girl. After being moved from the only home she's known, Rose has to adjust to a more regimented residence, bullies, and an overbearing headmaster. Though tested at every turn, she never sways from her true kind nature, and she sets an example of love and forgiveness for everyone.The movie is noticeably a lower budget film with so-so writing, directing and acting, but the story is precious. Bailee Johnson was adorable in the role of Rose. Edward Herrmann (Oz, Gilmore Girls, The Lost Boys) played cranky Mr. Crampton and held his own.Although this film is written, directed and produced by Christians/Mormons, the film doesn't get preachy at all. This heart- warming, story is basically about hope, compassion, and forgiveness, and it is a great movie for the entire family. Dec 2014 (5 stars for the production, 9 for the story/moral = a 7-star rating in my Humble Opinion)
