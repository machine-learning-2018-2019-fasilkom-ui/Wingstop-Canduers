Just saw this film on Amazon. Well worth the watch for anyone old enough to remember the days of "The Big Three" network television, where the guest stars were almost as regular as the series stars.That said? I got the sense Ms Oliver never quite 'fit in' to whatever task, professional or otherwise, she was pursuing. The possible exception being her early theater days.She obviously was a very bright woman with plenty of talent, never mind the devastating good looks. And while most of the interviewee's recall a very vivacious and positive spirit, with a good nature? I just got the sense she always wanted to be somewhere else, deep down inside.I was very saddened by the manner of her passing, in which it seemed she was really tired of fighting, and or living.And I'm not being critical of her here. This was just how I interpreted this film.The doc itself really hadn't hooked me at first. It almost seemed like a bland old "A&amp;E" bio from the 80's, without the high production values.But in the last half hour, a sudden abundance in attention to her deeper personal life grabbed me. Her relationship to her mother, lack of a long term relationship, childless, and eventually the manner of her death was just? Sad. There is no other way to describe it, for me.I'm glad the doc was made, as Susan's is a story worth telling.Things may have been much different for her, in terms of her aspirations, had she been born 10-15 years later.Again, for those from this era, I'd recommend this.
