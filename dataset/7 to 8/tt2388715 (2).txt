I watched this film to see what Karen Gillan got up to after Doctor Who, and I have to admit I was very impressed by her performance. By all of the performances, actually, though there is a very small cast.As others have said, this movie was not too graphic, but there were some situations so cringe worthy I couldn't watch them anyway. One scene in particular which involved an apple, I just had to turn away from. As far as formula, my daughter and I took bets on the ending about a third of the way through. I pretty much called it, but wasn't completely sure until the last five minutes. Not too formulaic, not too out of left field, no clear explanation given but a lot implied. I enjoyed this one a lot, but hope that there isn't a sequel, it's very good where it ended.
