This was surprisingly good! The story of this movie is a bit different from your typical romantic comedy. Some of the jokes are really bawdy, so be prepared.The actors are all good but Sara Paxton really steals the show. She's amazingly talented. She has played many different and diverse roles by now and has always done a great job in my opinion. She is equally good with comedy, drama and horror. It think she deserves much more recognition and needs to get more lead roles.I'm really baffled that currently less than 600 users have rated this movie even though it has been out for almost one and a half years. More people need to see this!
