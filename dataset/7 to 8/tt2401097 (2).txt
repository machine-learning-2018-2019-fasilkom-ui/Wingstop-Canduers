Hey, I am fed up with IMDb Reviews... most of them are really misleading... That's why I created my own account, just to write my own review.The Plot is quite good, but might remind you of several movies you saw in the past. I won't gonna name them. I have been parkour'ing/freerunning in the past, and that is the main reason I wanted to watch this movie. In all aspects of parkour this movie was really correct and entertaining visually. Really close to movies like Yamakasi or Banlieue 13. Not a fan of Taylor Lautner, but that kid did great, I didn't do the research but i think most of the tricks he did himself. I am 23 years old male guy and I generally enjoyed this movie. Wasn't hoping for much, but it really surprised me. Acting was enough to make me believe and the action was great. I think you should try it out. DVD option will do the trick. Good Luck.
