As a Hendrix fan I have read most of his biographies. So I was excited to see this movie. Actually, as a fan I am excited about anything Jimi Hendrix.I think most people reviewing the film take themselves as fans too serious. I respect those that are attempting to keep the integrity of Jimi Hendrix legacy intact, but some people are really going overboard.So, focusing on film itself: Loved it! I think Andre really did a great job at playing Jimi. I also thought the acting was very good. The writers did a great job considering the estate wouldn't work with them. It may not have been 100% historically accurate but it definitely was NOT garbage. It is a very good movie.So for those of you that have not seen the movie - watch it from a movie lover's stand point. Watch it from a fan's perspective. If you do so, you will appreciate the movie. It you approach it from a critics standpoint, because you "knew" Jimi or you have read every book or you are/where Jimi's biggest fan - you may not appreciate the art.
