I knew and met Rich several times when I was a Christian Concert Promoter. I have mourned his loss for a very long time. I agree with one reviewer who said that the film was rather dark and perhaps some of our darkness reflects in the film so that makes it darker. I do wish that there was a little more of his quick humored funniness that came out in the movie, but I think I understand why it didn't as much. For one reason, it was done through the eyes of close family. They hurt for his hurts and probably are closer to that at times. Especially when he's gone and you were unable to fix it for him. Second because so few saw the struggles he had which just increases the realness and the authenticity of how God works with us. But let me say this. He was an amazing profound and deep poet. He was a saint who related to Christ's sufferings equally to his blessings and in doing so almost always seemed to be directly dialed to him. Second, he had huge talent! Third he had a truly sacrificial heart! He was amazing! Lastly, I thought I would hate the film any way because after all who could ever be Rich ? Even pretend or act to be Rich? I enjoyed the film more than I thought I would. I think they did a good job that was one of the toughest. When you play Lincoln or George Washington. There aren't too many people around to know how they were in real life. I would say they did as good as they could and it was awesome and entertaining and moving! It even touched my life as a father to my kids. Was it as good as seeing Rich do Rich? Well, it was the next best thing, but wish I had more time with him. He was once in a life! Love you Rich! See this movie. You'll not regret it!
