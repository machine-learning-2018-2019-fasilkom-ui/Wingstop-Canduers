I have been following the development of this film and was disappointed when it could not achieve theatrical release. The minute it came out on DVD, I got on my bike and headed down to Walmart. I have watched it twice. There are things in the film production I can criticize, like the length of Mullins' hair in different scenes, but that is pointless. The fact is, the film drove me to Brennan Manning who I had no knowledge of. I consider the most important scenes in the film, the ones with Mullins and Manning. I actually had to go to IMDb to find out who Manning was. Since then, I have read The "Ragamuffin Gospel" and purchased two copies for friends. Rich Mullins was a messed up genius whose faith never wavered. That came through loud and clear in the film. He was not ashamed of his shortcomings and addictions. When Manning tells him God will ask only one question when you die: "Do you know how much God loves you?", I think Mullins could answer 'Yes,' despite his problems. This is a film that inspires the viewer to look deeper into the subject matter, and for that single reason, it is a success. For that single reason, you need to watch this film despite its flaws.
