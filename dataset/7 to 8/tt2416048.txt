I saw Christ Complex at the Colony Film Festival last fall. The film, directed by Jeffrey Scott Richards, is filmed like a play on film. Long static shots, filmed on consumer equipment, becomes distracting to the viewer after a while. The only reason I didn't give up hope on this film was the acting and the script. First off the script is like Kevin Smith meets Woody Allen laced with cocaine. The dialogue is sharp and although the actors do a great job they can't keep up with the snappy wit. I almost wish the writer would have dumbed down his dialogue.Speaking of the actors, I have not seen actors with this kind of range in micro-budget films since the days of John Waters. Todd Stubbe, plays Quinn (the lead "angel") like Tom Hanks from the movie Big. Chris Parsons is so perfect that it's a wonder why he hasn't moved on to a career in Hollywood. The lead "Zoey" has a quirky charm. The actress that stood out to me the most though? Very adorable girl, who plays a "mystery character", that shows up in the films epilogue. After seeing her I realized the film needed more of her presence. The filmmaker mentioned in the Q&amp;A that the budget was around $1000. Considering the limitations, Christ Complex is not a bad entry in the micro-budget film genre.
