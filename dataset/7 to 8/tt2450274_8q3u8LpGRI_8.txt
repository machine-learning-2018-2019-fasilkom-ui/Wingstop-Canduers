THe film is a must see for athletic women about how seventy year old women gain solid values (friendship, camaraderie, fun, fitness) from playing on a sports team. I love this film. The novice filmmaker has accomplished making a documentary that brings out the characters and soul of the team of grannies. This is a story worth telling, and that is the value of the film. I've given a rating much higher than the film merits because I love the story. For me in North Carolina, this is a local story about local people, though it translates well to a wider audience about this national championship team. Each of the 'grannies' tells their story about why they play on the senior basketball team, and the importance that playing on the team has played in their lives. Besides the individual 'interviews' there is a lot of actual on court playtime filmed. Imagine: a play by play commentary of seventy year old grannies on the basketball court. Something not many imagine, but perhaps should.
