Its Grand Laughter Entertainment!'Grand Masti' Synopsis: Meet, Prem, and Amar look to have a blast at their college reunion, though they soon find themselves in another predicament.'Grand Masti' is vulgar, crass &amp; crude from start to end. The humor laced in the narrative in all of those 130-minutes of running-time will Strictly Appeal to the Youth &amp; Men. Women are sure to be offended, as most of the jokes &amp; even the dialogue, are derogatory &amp; sex-related. Being an adult-comedy, 'Grand Masti' triumphs over a laugh-out-loud first-hour &amp; the series of events the 3 male protagonists encounter, are over-the-top, but absolutely hilarious. The second-hour dips and the jokes aren't funny enough, but the climax rides up the pace. Milap Zaveri &amp; Tushar Hiranandani's Screenplay is no-holds-barred &amp; offers vulgarity in abundance. A Special Mention for the crass but crackling one-liners! Indra Kumar, A Veteran in Comedies now, gets his job right. Cinematography is ordinary. Editing is fair. Music by Anand Raj Anand &amp; Sanjeev Darshan is decent. Performance-Wise: Vivek Oberoi, Aftab Shivdasani &amp; Riteish Deshmukh reprise their roles &amp; they are in top form. Vivek proves his versatility once again by portraying an out-and-out comic role, while Aftab &amp; Riteish are already known for their exceptional comic-timing. Also, The Trio share a superb on-screen chemistry throughout. Sonali Kulkarni, Manjari Fadnis &amp; Karishma Tanna are strictly okay. Maryam Zakaria, Kainaat Arora &amp; Bruna Abdullah add a lot of glamour in the goings-on. Pradeep Rawat is excellent. Suresh Menon is funny.
