I'll keep this brief but the film was very well executed! Definitely a unique and tasteful take on "found footage" even though this is no where near. The film tells the story from a first person narrative and delivers beautifully! The unfolding of events happens in a timely manner and is the farthest thing from predictable. The set design was phenomenal as well as the acting. I feel like these films have the potential to flop with even the slightest mistakes yet this gem managed to pull through with daring concepts and tie all all ends together nicely. I would recommend this to all horror connoisseur's and am fairly confident you will enjoy the ride. My one and only complaint is the gore. A couple shots were decent but for the most part it was lacking in believability.
