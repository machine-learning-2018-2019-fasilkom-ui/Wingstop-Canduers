For me this documentary was not only about problems in school based on color even though its an important part of the movie. But more so about the objectification of kids by the school and by the parents. Even grief is not allowed cause you have to do good grades or you're more or less worthless. Its to much about status and grades and to little of what the kid really like and encourage that. Especially one of the kids are the parents status symbol and he have to represent the parents own imagined greatness (and when he can't match expectation life gets really hard for the kid ..who is kind of lost) When a kid wants another higher education than the parents had in mind, its obvious that the parents could just stop helping him, and they nearly do that in the documentary just cause its not the education they wanted their child to have (status and so on). It shouldn't be like that young people need help from the government and it shouldn't be expensive to study. Its not a good start in life cause higher education should be a way out of your home and being more independent. If your parents control you with money they could seriously influence you to take negative choices for yourself.
