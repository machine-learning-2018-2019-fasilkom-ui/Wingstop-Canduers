Absolutely riveting movie. Be prepared to grab your seat many times, there are some really scary moments! I found the beginning quite meaningful as the climbers passed various Indian Holy men praying and meditating. What the 3 climbers were about to do really required divine protection. The photography is stunning, especially with the stars whirling around over Meru. What comes across to me is the supreme team work and total trust in your partners. Conrad puts together the team and sets the objective. His partners Jimmy and Renan add their enormous set of diverse skills to enable the successful completion of the climb. Conrad has the wisdom accumulated over many years of climbing to know when to pull the plug and when to push on. We are introduced to each climber and the serious setbacks that they all have but they still push on. Marvelous.
