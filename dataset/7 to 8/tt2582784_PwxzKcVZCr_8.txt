This is one of the most offbeat and weird movies I have seen in a while, in a good way! It's funny, raunchy, and really unpredictable. It also manages to be sweet(in a kinda weird, but still!), which I didn't think it would.. Not for everyone, but if you are up to seeing something different and aren't easily offended, give it a shot!
