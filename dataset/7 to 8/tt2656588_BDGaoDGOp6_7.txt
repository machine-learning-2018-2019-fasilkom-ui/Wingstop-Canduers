This is not a bad movie if you like this sort of movies.And what sort of movie this is? Well, think the original "office" series (the British version, not the American one) and you will be in the ballpark. But make no mistake because this movies is not a comedy...at least, not all of it.The majority of the movie leans towards a comedy, but then you start realizing that the message on this movie is that there are actually guys like the main character, which may make you feel a bit umconfortable.In fact, I am willing to bet that most of us know someone like him, or may have been him a while ago. It is a phase that we all have. A phase where life is a bit like a game, and it is hard to discern between fantasy and real world, between good and evil, between what is legal and what is not.But while we are all supposed to end that phase as we enter adulthood, some people stay there permanently. That is hardly an spoiler as the main character makes that fact clear from the get go......then again this movie has a couple of tricks down its sleeve that you will not want to miss.My complain about the movie is that some scenes are far too long, and while it works in some cases (one of them its really hilarious) in others you just wish the movie to be over already. Cutting this scenes to the necessary length, and perhaps expanding a bit more the end, would have a much better effect in my humble opinion.Still its a movie worth watching if you are into "the office".
