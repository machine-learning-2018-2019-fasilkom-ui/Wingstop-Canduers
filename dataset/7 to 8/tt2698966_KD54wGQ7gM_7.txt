In a sea of summer films packed with CGI and special effects, Writer and Director Barney Elliott has delivered a smart, clever, and thoughtful, multi-narrative thriller based on a historical reform that took place in 1968. Stephen Dorff stars as a New York financier who will go against all odds to settle a business deal with a Peruvian farming community, a deal which has implication to destroy their way of life. The Debt is a thrilling mystery rooted in realistic, honest characters who are joined by the force of having to make a decision with the effects being out of their control. Definitely worth a watch this summer.
