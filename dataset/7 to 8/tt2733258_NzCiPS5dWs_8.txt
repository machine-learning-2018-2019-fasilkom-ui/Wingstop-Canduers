In this case it is style over substance. There is something hidden and you may be able to decrypt it. But if you don't you'll either still love it or you will be annoyed by the fact that it's nothing like anything else you've watched the last couple of years. The movie always challenges you and even when you think you figured it out, there is something coming up muddling the water.It's a tough sell for some, but an easy if you want to watch something that is not explainable. Even if I wanted to tell you the story, I wouldn't be able to. It's about a man and a woman. Or is it? It's about one apartment ... but is it? It's about a detective ... or is he? If Dario Argento actually would have evolved and he had some artistic flair, he might have been the one doing these movies. As it is, we get this couple, who might not want to explain what they were thinking when they made the movie, but we know they had a master plan ... is it enough for you to enjoy though?
