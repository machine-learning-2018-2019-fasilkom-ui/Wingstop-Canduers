"Your dark side is your best side" a man is told as he searches secret passageways of his art-nouveau residence in Brussels. He may be searching inside himself or within his dreams. His wife is missing and presumed murdered along with others in the complex. Things seem to get murkier the more he looks into them. Elegant, bold, sinister, shadowy and stimulating, this film will have to be watched again and again, even by Kafka, in order to make better sense of it. It was intentionally designed this way. Eerie and piercing sounds heighten the effect of the stylish images. At times the repetitive images were too much for me, yet the film is absorbing and beautiful in all its darkness. Seen at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival.
