Being visually stunning this movie is great essentially for its amazing cinematography and the way the camera is used. Detailed and wonderful plans, vivid colors, amazing sets inside Art Deco buildings; it all have an astonishing visual effect.The plot is mysterious and complex. It's all about a murderer that is killing people inside their houses, but without breaking anything or leave any clue. But who is this murder anyway? It's one of those movies you can't figure out the entire plot at the first sight! At least I didn't! But I was amazed with the strange colors of this film!
