I had mixed feeling about this when going to the theater but I was glad after watching this. The movie is funny and i mean not forced funny but actually witty funny, even though the movie is centered around the main actor Varun. everyone produces the performance required for the movie to be successful especially rajpal yadav and anupam kher were fantastic.The actresses look really hot, the songs are catchy ,the actions are both outrageous and entertaining, the dialogues are original and funny and the plot has an important twist , and it never gets boring, so trust me you will certainly laugh out loud, a David dhawan special
