We've seen tons of horror films from the past filled with clichés like foreign tourists who dares to travel in an unknown place despite warnings from locals due to hidden horrors. Unlike The Blair Witch Project, this one is quite self-aware rather than preventing mystical legend of "Chupacabra" from outside world. True story: a day after watching Furious 7, I was curious about this low-budget horror film thanks to its dark background poster. Therefore, I decided to watch it alone with few audiences inside a theater. Surprisingly, while it has flaws ranging from typical horror clichés to few shortcomings, Indigenous scares me but not too much. While the entire cast is new, their acting is spot-on. Also, there's no sign of any CGI effects, only practical ones. Overall, I recommend everyone to watch this rare gem.
