I'm not really a horror fan so when get ready to watch one I read some best and worst reviews on the movie to lower or raise my expectations. With this one the reviews were around 50/50 but not a lot of users. So I took the chance, watched it and will give my 2 cents. First of all, I was entertained and not bored a single minute. For that I would already rate above 5. The unknown actors almost seem to "grow" both in their role and performance as the movie progresses. Pretty decent performance, job well done. The setting, fear and tension are convincing as well as the reactions of the characters. The monster is realistic although it does look like a monster type of the descent movies like someone said earlier. All in all, it's a nice popcorn &amp; beer movie to watch with your girlfriend to get a nice scare.
