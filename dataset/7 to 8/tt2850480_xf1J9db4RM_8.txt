I got to see this at the Jersey Shore Film Festival and I simply loved it. It tells the tale of two small town brothers, Jimmy (Piazza) and Victor (Mihok)continuing their existence when a beautiful young and mysterious girl (Waterhouse) buses into to town and seeps into their lives.It has many truly inspired moments, some epic shots, finely written characters, incredible production design and is superbly acted by all, especially Mihok and Waterhouse whose relationship is at the heart of this heartfelt movie. There are parts that were not as perfect where one could quibble, but who cares, these imperfections are completely absorbed by the beauty of the whole. Just like life.
