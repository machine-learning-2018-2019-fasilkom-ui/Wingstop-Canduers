What can I say, very humorous. .. well acted, camera work was well did. I thought the script was written well and the movie didn't drag out. Kept me fairly entertained throughout the movie. I own it! ... and I won't let go of it., so get your own! If this movie is a preview of things to come in Joe's line of work, I think he will do considerably well. I can't wait to snatch up the rest of his movies and any upcoming movies for that matter. Keefer Barlow had an outstanding performance. The rest of the cast did a fine job as well. If you like blood, sprinkled with comedy and layered between lots of flesh. ... this is definitely the movie you will need to add to your collection.
