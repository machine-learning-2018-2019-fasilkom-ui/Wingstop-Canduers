"Conjoined" is a twisted tale of a man's pursuit of love that will evoke a mixture of emotions you never thought you'd feel simultaneously. You'll laugh, you'll cry.. or you know, scream in horror! Most probably you'll end up finding yourself doing all three at the same time! This film has succeeded in making me feel awkward. LOL. There are moments in there that make me feel like , "Uhhh....what?" I can't even find a word to describe the feeling! LOL. You know how they say art imitates life? WELL, this movie really makes me wonder about the filmmaker's love life. HAHA! At the end of the movie, a thought ran across my mind: "What is wrong with them?!" Hahaha! I'm just teasing with that; however, in all seriousness I liked this movie because it's gruesome, it's dark, and it made me laugh. All in all.. It was a bloody good time. ;) Pun most definitely intended!With that being said and without giving too much away, I suggest you grab your popcorn and get as comfy as you can! This film is quite the experience! You don't want to miss it!
