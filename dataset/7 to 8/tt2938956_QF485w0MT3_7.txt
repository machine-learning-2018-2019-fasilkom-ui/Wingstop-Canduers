We enjoyed the first three movies, and were looking forward to see how the franchise reboot worked out.Deep meaningful characters? no. Completely unpredictable ending? no.Lots of car chases? yes. Cute girls? yes. A little tongue-in-cheek? yes. Would you go to the cinema to see it? no. Rent it? absolutely.Great for an evening where you want to relax and be entertained without too much (typical American movie) moral baggage and just enjoy some semi-violent fun.Great fun - will watch the next one if/when it comes out.
