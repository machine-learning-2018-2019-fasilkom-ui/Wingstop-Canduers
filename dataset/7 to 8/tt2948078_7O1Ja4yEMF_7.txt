It's low budget but not painfully low budget, actually looked pretty a number of times.The story did some new stuff in a tire genre so that was appreciated. Camera work was good, no shaky cam or found footage nonsense, it was simple and didn't get in the way. Reminded me of older horror films and that is a compliment due to the current state of the horror genre.Acting was above average for an indie. All the leads were consistent but some of the parts left a bit to be desired. The electrician was terrific, had me laughing pretty hard.The ending really got me, this is where the movie really earned some bonus points. Without spoiling anything, it was clever and didn't over explain, it actually gave me something to think about after. Thank you.
