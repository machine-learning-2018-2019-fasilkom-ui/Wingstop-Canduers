Lake Eerie does everything I like in horror that seems all too rare these days. First, the story takes its time introducing the characters, the plot, and the setting. This seems simple, however, it is so often rushed (or completely absent) in many modern horror films.Solid acting all around for an indie. One weak performance, but several really great performances, Betsy Baker being my favorite. The lead was also convincing, not to mention pretty.The story was intelligent and unique, with a surprising amount of depth to it. At first I thought I knew where the film was going, but I was way off. I love when a movie can do that.The music is superb and really ties everything together. It adds heaps of atmosphere to the film. The tone and atmosphere really stuck with me after watching it. It's one I'd watch again.
