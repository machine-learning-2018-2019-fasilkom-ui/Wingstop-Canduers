Lake Eerie was very unique, different and intriguing. I don't think it deserves these horrible reviews. It wasn't perfect, but it was entertaining. I enjoyed the stuff about Egypt and the Egyptian princess, I feel like there could have been more on that story line. I hope that people will give this film a shot and see it from a different perspective. Everyone can have their own opinion, but don't let it sway you from at least giving it a chance. Watch it for yourself and see what you take away from it. Just for the record: reviews shouldn't be used to blatantly attack others. If you don't like a movie, fine, but don't spread hate. No one deserves that.
