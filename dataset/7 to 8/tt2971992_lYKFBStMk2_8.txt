This documentary on the 2012 efforts to restrict abortion in Virginia premiered at the Austin Film Festival just blocks away from the Texas State Capitol where similar efforts unfolded in dramatic fashion around Wendy Davis's filibuster just a few months ago. Virginia could have been seen as a preview of what happened here in Texas. The film walks the line between documentary and advocacy. The film maker presents the dramatic events in Virginia in a reasonably fair manner, but his sympathies are clearly with the abortion advocates and providers. There are many more minutes of air time from the pro-choice advocates than the pro-life advocates; however, this is at least partly due to the fact that only 2 of the pro-life advocates were willing to be interviewed for the film. They certainly get to present their views, but it hard to say that they are presented in a way that most people would see them as sympathetic characters. They often come off as extremists. Of course, the viewer has to determine if that is fair way to understand them. The film is well-organized, entertaining, and informative about the latest phase of America's endless battle over abortion. The film is worthwhile for those wishing to better understand some of the complexity of this issue, but it should not be seen as fully objective. On the other hand, it hard to find anything that is fully objective on this issue.
