I took my 3 1/2 year old daughter to see this KID movie. (It is made for kids, people, chill out.) She adores the chipmunks and she loved the movie. It was cute with some genuinely funny moments. There was great music and lots of high-jinks. The roadtrip aspect of it was fun. There was some dancing and language that was semi-inappropriate that went right over my daughters head. I was sad that David Cross didn't come back for this sequel. He was the best part (IMO)of the previous installments. The guy replacing him as the 'villain' wasn't nearly as funny. But still, a fun and upbeat kids movie. We will definitely buy it when it comes out.
