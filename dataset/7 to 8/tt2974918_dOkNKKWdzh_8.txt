These films based on cartoons are not works of art, but they never try to be. For anybody that loves an Alvin and the Chipmunks cartoon, we'll probably enjoy this like you where entertained by the first three. The Chipmunks have a misadventure like road trip. I don't want to give to much away. This is just a fun ride, nothing more, it just a film to sit and watch and forget about your problems.Now Jason Lee as Dave looks like he only got five hours of sleep, kind of have the feel he doesn't want to be there. Tony Hale has some the funniest moments has a marshal chasing the chipmunks, he has a Steve Martin like thing going for him. It's a cartoon movie nothing more, I like it more than Yoga Bear and Scooby Doo.
