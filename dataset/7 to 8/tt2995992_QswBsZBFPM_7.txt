I never thought I'd end up reviewing an overtly commercial film like this but being Yash Raj Films' debut South venture and having surprisingly enjoyed the film, I'm compelled to do just that. Although positioned as a Tamil release, this film definitely feels more Bollywood than it should. Every shot, colour and sound is perfectly staged- almost too perfectly for a Kollywood production. Having not seen "Band Baaja Baaraat" probably helped as I've been able to skip the inevitable comparisons and, as a result, haven't found much to fault in the film. A couple of the scenes in the second half are long-winded and could have done with an edit. The real success of the release is of course its lead actor, Telugu star Nani. I can't think of one film starring Nani where he didn't totally own the scenes he was in. This is his 2nd Tamil film (after 2011's "Veppam") and a much higher profile vehicle for him as an actor. Vaani Kapoor does a decent job but was a strange choice for a South launch film; either way their on-screen chemistry is believable (most of the time) and their rapport seems to work. A decent effort.
