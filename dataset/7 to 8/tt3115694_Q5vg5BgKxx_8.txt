An engaging and intriguing movie, depicting the degeneration of family relationship in modern cities, which consume genuine love and compassion in humanity.Four people find themselves in an asymmetric and awkward relationship in a huge and fancy house. It is no secret that many beautiful houses hide horrible homes; many well- dressed bodies hold miserable souls. But what is the chance of complete metamorphosis?In Starcrossed, actors match their characters and they play them flawlessly... But, I had difficulty to understand how those characters with complicated and volatile relationship let each other stay alone in pairs, for so long, and so many times... That should explain the reason for the deduction of one star :) As for the second lost-star: the culprit was x-rated scenes, which I had to fast-forward. I wish, the author/director had taken the creative challenge to convey the intimate relationships with only subtle references, short scenes and innuendos.I command the young author/director/co-producer Chase Mohseni (his name sounds like his parents have a very interesting story for his next movie) for his ambition and success in his first film. With such a start, I will not be surprised if I hear his name mentioned in an Oscar night within 19 years from an obnoxious host. Who knows, for writing the best script, for directing the best film, or for acting. He is a polymath and ambitious, and I am sure he will show us all.
