When I saw this movie on amazon, I assumed it was a soft-core porn flick, but then the film starts with the messaged about how teen girls are exploited for sex. that really ruin my high.The movie tries to cover everything you ever herd about teen prostitution and role it up in one girl, and it becomes a series of adventures in her life. Semi episodic going from one segment to another, but it does help to get the message across. It is a realistic story about survival trying to be very leveled in telling us what it takes to be a girl in this position. Yet still, the opening tiled message does help to get me in the tone of the drama this is suppose to be, the movie still kinda feels like a soft-core porn. It never ever gets out of that mood.For me it does not make this an easier pill to shallow. In fact it does what a work of art should do...it makes me think, about the young girls who go into porn and I've seen at strip clubs and what actually got them there.So, great film to watch, with a great message, unless your one of those guys who lives at the strip club, than this might mess up your head a little (or at lease I hope it does).
