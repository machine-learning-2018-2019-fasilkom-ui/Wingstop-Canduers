I really enjoyed the movie. Very tragic story, but a very real story. The only problem I had was the fact that I know the movie doesn't even begin to scrape the real horrors of the underbelly of Los Angeles. However, most of the cast clearly acted their butts off for their roles. Great movie, well made, but it just doesn't touch the tip of the iceberg of how dangerous the life path for these young girls are. American child sex traffic is a real problem in the United States, but the sad part is is that a huge percentage of these girls are forced into this kind of lifestyle. No child should ever have to go through this, and no female should be a victim of life itself. My heart and prayers go out to the unfortunate who are experiencing all this as we speak.
