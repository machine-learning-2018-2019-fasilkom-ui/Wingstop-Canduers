What can I say about this independent gem. Yes, it's a gem because you really got into the life of the 15 year old girl. Her life is just one piece of trash. Growing up with her mother isn't fun. Mother has no money so prostitution is the only remedy to earn money.The girl has to wait in the car for her mother while she's doing it so slowly she also gets into the world of selling your body. Jessica Taylor Haid playing the 15 year old prostitute gives an excellent performance. It's was her first flick and to do all this stuff you see a big thumb up. There's a lot of nudity going on and some will be offended by it because she's fifteen of course.Not a happy movie after all and shows the life of so many youth in the USA. No work is no money is no place to stay. Great performances, good filming and editing, okay there's a continuity fault on the beach with the girl her socks but hey. If that's all...if you find this and can stand sad stories then pick it up.
