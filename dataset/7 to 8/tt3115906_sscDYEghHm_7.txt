This is by far the best Indie film I've seen in a long time. I wasn't sure what to expect but it was incredibly intriguing and had me through the whole film. The acting was great, and the plot was disturbing in the best way. An eye opener for sure! I've never seen anything like it, and looking forward to more from this director..
