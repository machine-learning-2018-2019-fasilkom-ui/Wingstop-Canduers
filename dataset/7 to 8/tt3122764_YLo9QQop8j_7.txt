I can't say I "enjoyed" this - more like it horrified me that there was such segregation and racism still alive. The whole "black prom" and "white prom" is sickening to me.So it was very enlightening, but I felt like the main story of Norman Neesmith was pretty slanted and unfair. The whole time I was just saying "Where the hell was the daughter?" I don't want to write a spoiler, but none of this murder smacked of racism to me. The guy seemed like maybe he was in a rage, but the issue of the daughter wasn't raised until the very end, and her involvement and response to everything that happened that night was muted, at best. Also the lighting to make her look more white was kind of sad.Don't get me wrong, Norman Neesmith seems like something of an idiot and his whining about all this affected him makes you want to puke. But he raised a black child, had black children to his pool, and generally was anything but a racist.But the bias that you'd expect in a liberal activist's work aside, it really was interesting and moving.
