If you like sports movies you should definitely watch it. I don't know anything about baseball yet I just loved it. It may be low-budget - and I'm generally not into sports movies - but few minutes later I found myself laughing. And I think you don't have to know so much about baseball or love it to "get" the movie. You just need to have the ability of empathy to understand the players. Keep up the good work, Joe!
