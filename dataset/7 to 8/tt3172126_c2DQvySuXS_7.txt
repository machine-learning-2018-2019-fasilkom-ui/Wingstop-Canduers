Went to look at the user reviews and realised there's none here so I said I'd right a quick one. Its about a local baseball team where one of the players doesn't get drafted when he supposedly should have. It takes place over one match in the play off semi final. Its low budget I like the concept its got a bit of drama and a few laughs. The acting is decent is well i think its worth the watch.If you like low budget sports movies this is really good even as big sports movies go it shows a lot more of the game than most, kinda has to as it takes place during one game but i found that to be nice something different.Anyway I enjoyed it and would say its worth the watch
