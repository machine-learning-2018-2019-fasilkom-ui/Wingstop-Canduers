It's a low low budget movie but the producers almost pulled off a miracle in telling this story in an entertaining, engaging way. There were some audio problems and some lighting inconsistencies here and there but the plot was good, the dialogue fair and the acting mostly convincing. ****SPOILER - the actual killer reveal at the end is a little over the top and almost unbelievable. And how could the LT cop not question why the protagonist wife was there at the final shootout - that's one huge pothole. Why was she not arrested?As usual, the villains are one dimensional evil scumbags so you don't care when they get whacked off. The protagonists-cops - are fleshed out enough to care about them and their dilemmas, so that keeps the viewers involved. Though a little crude and half baked it is still compelling and captivating. Would I see it again? Maybe 1 more time.
