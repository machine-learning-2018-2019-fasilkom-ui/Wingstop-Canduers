Movie tag-line - "How did you learn about sex?" Believe me - Whether you're a pro, a prude, a pervert, or a peasant - Sex education (definitely) benefits all.Even though I seriously thought that way too many "talking heads" popped up (far too often) in this "human-sexuality" documentary - Once the vintage "sex education" film-clips started rolling (especially the ones from the 40's, 50's and 60's), I was more than satisfied while watching Sex (Ed): The Movie.From discussing such pressing topics as - Nocturnal emissions, VD, menstruation, and "putting it" inside her - This enlightening, informative, and, yes, often hilarious presentation will certainly open your eyes to how attitudes towards sexuality have changed (or have they?) over the past 70 years (and not always for the better).P.S. - If you're looking for a laugh (and a bit of a shock, as well) - Just wait till you see the sex-ed film-clips (from the early-1940's) that were specifically geared to the sexual guidance of men in the military.
