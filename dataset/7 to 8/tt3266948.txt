An ex-boxer comes out of jail after 12 years and tries to re-build his life. It's a familiar tale but for a small film it does punch above it's weight for large periods.It's all fairly low key apart from the final half hour but a decent cast make this fairly enjoyable. Sean Bean isn't the most versatile of actors but I thought he did a good job here showing a vulnerability he doesn't always get the chance to show. Eva Longaria also does a good job and the chemistry between her and Bean does a lot to drag the film along. Good support is provided by Tom Arnold and Kate Walsh and there is a promising performance by Nolan Gross as Beans young nephew.Whilst this could have been annoyingly predictable a decent script makes this more interesting than expected. Although not without it's faults ( some of the scenes towards the end are a bit clumsy) I'm surprised that as it stands this has such a low rating 5.0 (651 votes). Based on that rating I wasn't expecting much but this was far more enjoyable than expected. Well worth watching if you have a spare couple of hours to kill.
