The Journey is the destination is well worth a watch, the story of the film is genuinely moving highlighted by the fact that the characters are real people and is inspired true events. It admittedly is a slow starter where i disliked the main character a lot being as other reviews have put it a somewhat stuck up "privileged white boy". However this sets the course for the rest of the film as Dan Eldon grows as a character, developing from the things he has seen and experienced in his life that we witness alongside him. I see people complaining the film took them to dark places which it arguably does but i do not see this as a bad thing. While the film is undeniably emotional i felt it excellently portrayed the complexity of being a reporter while also having to deal with your own feelings on what your reporting. The directors did this in a hard hitting way which was much better suited tot he story than the usual Hollywood style of either over the top action or sunshine and daisies everyone seemed to want from this film. While this movie may not be for everyone i feel its definitely worth a try, and taught me something new about a person i have never heard of before but now have tremendous respect.
