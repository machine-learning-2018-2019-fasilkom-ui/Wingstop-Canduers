Beautiful.It's a beautiful story. I was not expecting such a amazing tale.It's about an old man who tells his granddaughter about a relationship he had with a pelican when he was a young boy.Everything just lined up perfectly with the story. I especially love the score playing in the background.Thought it was incredible that they were able to get these birds to do such good acting.Worth seeing.
