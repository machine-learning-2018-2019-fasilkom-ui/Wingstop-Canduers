F you're going to remake an Australian classic it must be compared to the Original did anyone else get past the first episode of the recent dreadful television version of Picnic at Hanging Rock?
Storm Boy is 1000% Superior to that awful insult.
BUT!
After we saw this new version of Storm Boy today I watched the Classic Award winning 1976 version ,which I much prefer because of its beauty and simplicity and David Gulpilill's ( he has a brief cameo as Fingerbones father in the newest version) superb portrayal of Fingerbone Bill, which to my mind is watered down in this new version and in its place we have Geoffrey Rush's new character the adult and aged Storm Boy Mike Kingsley and the new plot line of greedy Corporate land grabs, my other criticism is not directed at Jay Courtney 's acting in the role of Storm Boys father Hideaway Tom it's just that he's too clean cut and nice compared to Peter Cummins rough castaway personality in the same role in 1976.
I'm not saying this is a bad movie ,it's worth seeing the cast is good ,especially Finn Little as Storm Boy and Geoffrey Rush is a fine actor but when I watched the original version I asked myself the question Does this new version add anything more to the story ? and my answer was the opposite I think it diminishes the indigenous spirit and atmosphere of the 1976 version and replaces it with a hard contemporary sub plot that intrudes on the integrity of Colin Thiele's original story and reminds me of the saying " if it ain't broke don't fix it.
