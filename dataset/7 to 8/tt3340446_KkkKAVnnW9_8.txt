A visually stunning Australian film that has worldwide appeal for people of ALL ages. The themes about family, friendship, love, loss and loneliness are universal and rounded out with a message of hope for a better future. This is a throughly enjoyable and emotional "retelling" of Colin Thiele's book of the same name which has been in print for over 55 years. This is not a remake - this is a retelling and should not be compared to the 1976 version. This film stands on its on merit, it is beautifully shot and superbly acted. It's a remarkable film that will stay with you forever.
