Perhaps it's because I can't remember the original but I found this film to be very well crafted and moving. I don't understand the criticism I've read from the various professional critics. I say see it. If you don't feel the urge to tear up you're made of stone and probably not a movie lover. I liked the way it was framed and the wistfulness Geoffrey Rush brought to his role. It's a credit to all involved.
