I believe some of the criticism of this remake is harsh. It is easy to think of the original which was a much loved film and say that this is not up to the same standard. The filmmakers seem to have deliberately chosen not to replicate the first and should be congratulated for not doing so. It is lovingly filmed and is nicely edited between flashbacks of the old and young Michael. Performances are solid without being outstanding. There are nice moral messages without going over the top. Take the obligatory tissues for films with animals. These parts are nicely filmed and not over the top. Please don't choose not to see the film because of Geoffrey Rush's appearance. Think of it as a great actor playing a terrific part. I think that if people go in with an open mind, not think about the original and see this on its own merit, I think most will come away saying, 'this is a nice film'.
