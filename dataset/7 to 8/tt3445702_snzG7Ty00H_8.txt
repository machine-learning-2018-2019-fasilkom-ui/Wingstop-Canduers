I like weird stuff. Give me some Lynch, Noe or Jodorowsky and I'm a happy camper. This isn't quite as surreal (or as good) as those masters. It's a descent into drugs and meaningless sex. It's well made. Performances are terrific - Judd Nelson can proudly throw his fist in the air for this one! Better than Beastmaster.
