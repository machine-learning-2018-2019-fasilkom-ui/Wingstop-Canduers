Okay fine I'll admit it I'm a big Despicable Me fan and I love minions, don't judge me!I thought both of the first two Despicable Me movies were fantastic and to a lesser extent enjoyed Minions (2015) so logically I was going to enjoy this, but did I?Well it has the same charm, it has the great voice talent, it has a stellar soundtrack and it has minions! What is there to dislike?Well I don't dislike it but truth be told it's not on par with the other movies, I don't know quite what it was but I just wasn't feeling it this time as a lot of the jokes missed their mark, the minions took a backseat and the twin brother aspect of the plot was a tad weak.Regardless Despicable Me 3 is a lot of fun for all the family complete with lots of jokes that the parents will appeciate and a great retro 80's soundtrack. Being a big South Park fan I really appreciated the work put into this by Trey Parker, he's a multi-talented fella as demonstrated here.The franchise still has life in it and hopefully won't be going away anytime soon.BANANA!The Good:Great soundtrackSame ol'charmTrey ParkerThe Bad:Story is weaker than previous filmsThings I Learnt From This Movie:Giant titan mechs can be made by one single person in a matter of daysTrey Parker needs more voice workI want a uni-goat!If she doesn't get fluffy back in the next movie I'm rioting.........awkwardly..........by myself
