I watched this as a fan of punk and a fan of rock documentaries. I was never completely sold on the Damned, more of a Pistols fan, but I was interested in the people behind the publicity photos, behind the rock image, the stories they had to tell. This film delivers all of that a little too powerfully at times, as while it makes its director look good, it makes the group look a little sorry. Brian James and Rat Scabies come across as broken old men, even if they have a great story to tell. Dave Vanian comes across as a good and loyal singer for the group who lacks the big personality to sell the group as well as Johnny Rotten and Joe Strummer. Only Captain Sensible really seems to have improved with age. We see him as cheerful, personable with fans, a better front man than Dave Vanian, a great guitarist. Again, you wonder at his loyalty to the group. As a viewer you want the film to have a happy ending, for the group to get their million dollar cheque, but it never arrives.
