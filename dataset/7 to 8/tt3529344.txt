Its not great, but okay, I mean we have so many films about similar premise. First I think - "400 days", but when there film go to sci-fi, there - to thriller. I don't say its bad, I say its very bland. And yeas I can see how writer|director love this theme, but why you choose another to-Mars project? Mb you think this is or realistic then others? Well in someway - yes, actors play good, part with too directors - not bad, but little boring and like many thing (I tell about Nally) - leads no where. Actor really try to play and do good job, but script - sometimes too weak (I mean - scene with Sacks and Julia - so quick, so unnatural, he lost his daughter and wife!). And yes - black Christian and his relationship with Thom - its really good. 10 of 10.
