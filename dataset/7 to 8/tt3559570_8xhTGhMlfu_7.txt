I'm not usually a fan of low-budget 'B' grade movies, however, this movie actually turned out to be a decent watch. There were some moments where I got annoyed at the characters (run- of- the-mill stereotypical reality show contestants - all completely different to one another),and also some parts where I was basically yelling at the screen "how could you be so stupid!!" None the less, it picked up quite fast at the beginning and I was interested throughout wondering what the fate for each of them was going to be. This was made in the style of a reality show with helmet cams filming most of it. If you're into survival TV shows, or want to try something a bit different, "2Survive" is worth a watch.
