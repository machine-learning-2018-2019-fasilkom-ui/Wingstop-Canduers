Much better than the rating it received (4.1). Don't let the fact that Erik Estrada appears in the trailer fool you. He is in the movie for a micro second. The acting is decent. I am not a fan of reality TV, and to be honest I quite surprised myself when I chose to watch this. I suppose I was bored and in the mood for some mindless entertainment. If I was being even more honest, I was looking for a reason to reinforce my already ample disdain for reality TV. The fact that it was set in a desert intrigued me. I wanted to see how badly they could muddle this up. I suppose the fact that I went into this movie excepting so little was a plus. It moves along nicely with each character well suited to their roles. I recommend it for a one time watch.
