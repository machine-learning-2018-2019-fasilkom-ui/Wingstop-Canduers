Based on some of the reviews that I have read, I didn't expect this movie to be all that good but I was gladly wrong. Every actor in this film did an amazing job bringing their characters to life which is something that is rare during films these days there's always that one actor that just doesn't get it quite right, but I loved all the performances. I really loved the romance between "Stevie" and Daria I personally love Torrey DeVitto which was why I watched this movie and I think she and Chris did an amazing job chemistry wise. The hit-man were a great add for the comedic aspect of the movie, you will possibly find yourself chuckling at their antics. Jumping back a little, I LOVED how the movie started with the black screen and someone telling the audience that Stevie is dead, that really drew me in and made me pity the character more and more throughout the film. I also loved near the end where everything was coming to be making you really sit at the edge of your seat.The only thing that I do agree with from the critics is the length. I do think it was a tad bit long for the plot to not be so complex, but with that being said every scene flowed together nicely, there wasn't anything that looked out of order or out of place.All in all I thought that this was a great film to watch, it's in the mix of a romcom but not quite haha. 7/10 Stars
