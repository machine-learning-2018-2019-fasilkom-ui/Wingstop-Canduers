The Real Stevie D is a funny, thought provoking and one can relate to the characters. The plot of the story is thought out and well executed by the entire cast. Really enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to all my friends to go and see! The role of each character is real and human and brings the story to life. With every twist and turn in the plot the viewer gets more and more of a glimpse of the plot and it's intricacy. Christopher Cordone, not only wrote and directed the film but essentially plays 2 different characters with ease and believable. The film is very well cast and each characters lines are perfectly written for them. Go see it and ENJOY!
