We enjoyed this. Lots of fun, nicely done story. Solid script. Actors/characters were pretty good. The direction lacked, a bit. Same guy wrote, directed, produced and starred in it, apparently. Might have been better to bring in another director? It just didn't "pop" as much as I think it could have with the script he wrote.
