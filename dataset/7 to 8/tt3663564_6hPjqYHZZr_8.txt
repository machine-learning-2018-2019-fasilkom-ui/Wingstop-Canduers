My husband and I liked this movie a lot. Although the storyline is tragic at its core, it had inspirational value that even through the darkest realities of life, love and hope can be sought and found in the most surprising simplistic aspects of life. I thought the acting quality was excellent. Great job actors and Charles Moore for putting together a great movie filmed in Cleveland Ohio.
