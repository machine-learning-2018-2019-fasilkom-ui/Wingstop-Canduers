This movie has a very powerful story and themes. It goes deep into the human mind and finds how relationships work. The characters are likable and interesting with more to them than what appears on the surface. It is paced very well and is very impressive. The only issues I have is the score is severely lacking in identity and doesn't feel organic and the ending, while has some very powerful moments, leaves some plot lines unfinished. I would recommend this to nearly anyone, the story (even if you can't find it too relatable) has a lot of things to say about love, family, and your past.
