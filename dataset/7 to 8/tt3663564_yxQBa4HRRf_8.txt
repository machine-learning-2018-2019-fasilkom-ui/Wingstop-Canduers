I have not seen a movie this good in years. It was produced with a very small budget, according to the director and producers, but has the look and feel of a large studio release. The movie is well cast, the acting is excellent. The story is well structured and the characters are believable and engaging. Everything is well put together from the editing to the soundtrack. Not for youngsters for sure, and even if you think you know where the story is going, you will be in for a surprise here and there. No car chase scenes with vehicles flying over gorges, no over-the-top pyrotechnics, no super heroes with magic powers...just a good story, well told. I encourage you to see this film when it is playing near you, or ask your local independent theater to inquire about showing it at their venue.
