Colorful and frank, this video gives viewers a good feel for the rough-and-tumble old days in space programs. The need for a military weather satellite was real and urgent . The Soviets had bad intentions and thermonuclear weapons. We needed to keep a sharp eye on then. But rather than images of missile deployments, our reconnaissance satellites were bringing back pictures of cloud tops. An Air Force wearier officer was told to fix the problem. This is his story.A cautionary tale, it suggests to us that simple and frugal often work way better than formal and glitzy. Unfortunately, not 1/10th of the story of the first operational satellite system is told here, and the participants are ot going to be around much longer, Lots of vintage footage, animation, and taking heads of vigorous old farts, A trifle disjointed, but well worth seeing.
