I started this movie assuming it would be yet another in Amazon Prime which I can not tolerate after three to five minutes. Instead I was immediately hooked and absolutely loved it. The writing was very witty and clever, as were all the sight-gags. Excellent direction as well - enhancing the success of the sight gags. All the actors played their roles perfectly. Was it silly? Yes, but so is the Scary Movie franchise. Silly can be bad or be very good, as Bubba is. Highly recommend, especially to those like me, raised in the rural South, and anyone else for that matter. Kudos to all the cast and crew. You made me laugh out loud more than once and that is not something I do often.
