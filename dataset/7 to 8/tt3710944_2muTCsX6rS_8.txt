The creator of Bubba the Redneck werewolf does a tremendous job with his project. It's funny, smart, a little gory and very fun. I think when they do the second one it'll be even better. The two main characters Bubba the Redneck werewolf and The Devil are the type of Characters that scream Cult classics. Good job.
