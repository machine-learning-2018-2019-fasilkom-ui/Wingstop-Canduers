This is a wonderfully campy horror comedy movie based on the comic book, "Bubba The Redneck Werewolf", created by Mitch Hyman. The movie was a long intense labour of love from everyone who was involved in it. That being said, this a fun silly movie that will become a cult movie classic for those who enjoy to knock back a beer, or three, or ten, as they enjoy watching movies where nothing is sacred and no one is safe from satire as the jokes fly just as much as ripped off limbs and spewing blood. The best thing about this movie is that it is written AND directed by the Mitch Hyman, the creator of the comic book, who also does a great job of stealing the show with his own acting as he portrays the devil himself, so it is definitely true to the original material! But if you just want a great funny, bloody movie to watch with lots of terrific one liners, then this is the one for you!
