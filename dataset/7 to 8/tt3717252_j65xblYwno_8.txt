I really liked this latest installment to the Underworld franchise. As a matter of fact, I like them all, but I really loved the new setting in this one. The directing, writing, cinematography/VFX were all top notch. Kate Beckinsale and Theo James were once again incredible in their roles, as was the rest of the cast. The special effects though were very well done and more evident in this film more so than previous films. It's an 8/10 from me!
