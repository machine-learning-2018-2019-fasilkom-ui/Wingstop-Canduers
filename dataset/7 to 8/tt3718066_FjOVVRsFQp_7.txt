If I could sum up this movie it would be fun. Once again, Captain Z has to battle demons after being freed when an unsuspecting victim reads an inscription on an amulet. When will humans learn not to read ancient Latin phrases off of evil artifacts? Okay the premise is hokey and the movie knows it and plays to it making it a laugh riot. I have seen a few independent horrors that have a great premise but the actors don't do it justice (Clown Hunt for instance) or have great acting but was not a coherent movie.This movie has both believable characters and great plot. if you love horror comedies this is definitely for you.
