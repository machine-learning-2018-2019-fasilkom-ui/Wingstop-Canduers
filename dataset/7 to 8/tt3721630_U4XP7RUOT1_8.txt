I saw this film at a film festival in Los Angeles and found it completely original and endearing. Laura Lee Bahr, the writer director is a novelist that I was familiar with previously. I was excited to see her first feature film. The story melds together such eclectic elements that trying to fit the film into a genre box becomes an impossible task. Set in Los Angeles with a struggling actress as our main character we follow her on a totally unique journey. Anyone who knows the film industry or Los Angeles will recognize the real life absurdity of both. It's funny first and foremost with great characters but also weaves in threads of suspense and action with a dash of romance. This is the kind of film that finds cult status. Horray for adorable dogs and and girls with guts!
