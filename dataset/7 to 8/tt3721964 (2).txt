I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! And do you know why? Because 
it was fun!! I didn't laugh out loud much but certainly had a smile 
on my face almost throughout the duration of the film. I don't think 
anyone has the right to tell anybody on here not to watch a movie 
as we all have different tastes, but I certainly had fun watching this
One.
