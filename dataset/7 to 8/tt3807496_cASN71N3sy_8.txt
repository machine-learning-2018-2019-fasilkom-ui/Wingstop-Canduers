I can see where some of those familiar with the history of the band Chicago might take issue with how the documentary was presented. While most of the documentary seemed reasonably accurate, there were a few of the stories that didn't seem to jibe with what I remember. Specifically the departure of drummer Danny Seraphine. For those unfamiliar with Chicago, this documentary is useful for bringing those viewers up to speed. From their beginning to their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, viewers are able to get an idea how the band has evolved over the last 50 years. I would highly recommend this documentary to anyone who wants to know who the band Chicago is.
