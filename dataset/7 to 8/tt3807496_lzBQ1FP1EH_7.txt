First half of this documentary was interesting, informative and offers viewers a great deal of background info using unique film techniques that worked really well. In the FIRST HALF of the film interviews with the band members were honest and provided thought provoking context for the various story lines. However viewers should keep in mind that this documentary was produced by the band and its founding members...So we only get one perspective. The one the band wanted us to see and hear. The result is a great deal of score settling in the second half of the documentary that goes unchallenged.The lone exception was Drummer Danny Seraphine who deserves high praise for his openness and honesty throughout.Bottom line...Impartial or objective are not terms to associate with this film. BUT Having said all that, The first half is a great watch.
