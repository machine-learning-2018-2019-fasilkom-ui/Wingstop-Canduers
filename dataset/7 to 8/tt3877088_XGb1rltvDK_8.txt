I came across this little indie film while scrolling through the endless dreck offered by Tubi TV, and what a find! Try to imagine the Peanuts gang in their 30's, with real-world problems and serious issues. The names are slightly different (I'm sure to avoid legal trouble), but it's not too difficult to figure out who's who between the comic strip and the movie. It's casually loaded with Easter eggs and well-placed inside jokes and references. It's by turns funny and touching, and surprised me by being much better than it should have been. Having grown up with Snoopy and Charlie Brown and the rest of the gang, I could easily tell this was written with love to one of the greatest comic strips of all time. Definitely worth hunting down and watching.
