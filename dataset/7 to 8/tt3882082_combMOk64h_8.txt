I watch a lot of horrors, I've rated about 800 so far (and probably seen about 300 more at the very least).And although this is not one of the better horrors I've seen I'd say it's still definitely above average.It's a mystery so I can't really talk too much about the movie without hinting at spoilers and such so I'll keep that to a minimum.It's basically a creepy doll movie but not overly silly made like for instance 'DEAD SILENCE (2007)' or a slasher-doll movie like the Chucky- movies it takes it's time to develop and keeps the mystery going for quite some time, which makes it feel a bit like a psychological thriller and keeps us wondering what's going on and what's next.Lauren Cohan who plays Maggie in the TV-series 'The Walking Dead' handles the lead well, and the cinematography is stunning.So yeah if you're looking for a new horror movie to watch this is a valid choice.
