This isn't the typical, linear look at a filmmaker's life and career. This is more about Kubrick the person, and his effect on those around him, as well as his filmmaking process. The movie is comprised of interviews with family, actors, crew members and others who worked or lived with Kubrick over the years. The focus is primarily on his post-Dr. Strangelove output, mainly because those people are still around to be interviewed, but some of his earlier work is also touched on. There are also scores of photos and behind-the-scenes video from his later films. Casual fans will find much of interest, and for Kubrick aficionados, this is a must-see.
