My husband and I love silly, over acted, horrible plot line movies and this doesnt disappoint. Addressing the elevator scene with the son and mom, all I can say is, hopefully that encourages the boy to start working out. As long as the cast had a good time making it, it's all gravy baby. There are good bad movies and bad bad movies. This is the former imo. Just embrace the bad decisions, overacting, and improbable scenarios.
