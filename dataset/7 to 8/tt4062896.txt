I have to sort of disagree with one of the reviews that a horse can't "change it's training". There have been many that changed their careers. However, I don't think this horse would be one of those. There is just too much information and access to real barrel racers that could have made the show much more realistic. First of all, a barrel race is just that - a race - not a trot and lope around the barrels! While they did try to get a lot of the lingo correct, they could have done better. There was just so much potential with this show, but it fell way short. Still a good, clean family film that to the non horseman or non barrel racer would be quite entertaining.
