This grew on me as I watched it. I found the acting too naturalistic to begin with but the film stuck with it and stayed true to itself and I warmed to the story, the characters and their predicaments. There is some great humour, including deadpan in the face of the bizarre or extreme, which was done very well indeed. I felt for and rooted for the main characters. I am not sure if my TV was playing up but the colour palette seemed close to monochrome at times. That may have been to contribute to the feel of the piece, giving a background of blandness against which the unexpected events stand out more vividly.
