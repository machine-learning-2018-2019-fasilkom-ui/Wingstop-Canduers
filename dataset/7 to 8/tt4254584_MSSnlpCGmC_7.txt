Kicks is a harsh realistic portrait of morally collapsed society - where violence is the main fact that decides "who you're".
Not even a single positive figure, never a trace of law, state. All families -if they are families- are degenerated, no hope for a dignified life. 
No education, no vocation, no profession; nothing at all. 
Where everybody is drugged and even drug dealer.
Kicks is beautifully shot. And rises with very well acting. Ali is a shining star but Siriboe I liked much. You can't help hating him. 
The day dreams of Brandon (Guillory) is a well designed contrast which maintaince dynamism to the flick.
