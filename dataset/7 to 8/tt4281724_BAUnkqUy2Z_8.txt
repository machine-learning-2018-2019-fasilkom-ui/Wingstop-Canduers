This movie was insane. I am a horror lover and I don't see a lot of horror movies that actually deserve to be called a horror movie. This one does. It definitely has some of a B movie vibe, but not at all in a bad way. I actually enjoyed that aspect because it felt like it added to the film. This movie is definitely twisted and graphic, but it delivers.
