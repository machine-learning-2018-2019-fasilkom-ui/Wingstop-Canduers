It was terrible in the 80's and it's terrible now .. but isn't that the attraction?
A weak plot and lots of blood and gore, A chase where the running victim constantly falls down, an opportunity missed to finish off what should be the upper hand.
Yes it's all there and all in good fun.
I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the early Friday the 13th movies and their B movie counterparts.
If you are looking for intellectual stimulation this is not for you!
