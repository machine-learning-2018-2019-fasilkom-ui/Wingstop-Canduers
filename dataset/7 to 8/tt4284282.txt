While watching this film it to me felt like a great combination of the Langoliers and The Cabin in the Woods but on a more personal level drawing the audience into the world and characters and the stories they all bring with them. Rather than following one specific threat that is attacking the group of protagonists we are faced with different villains from serial killers to cults to Bigfoot. The cast did a good job taking the script written by Geno McGahee and translated them very well. The film had a dark grit to it that paid a wonderful homage to 80's horror movies and has a great balance of suspense, horror, and some comedic moments making this film an entertaining watch.
