As soon as I saw the poster for this one, I knew I was going to like it. I am a bit of a sucker for a feel good sport movie, especially when they are based on true events like this one is.You can not go wrong with Jon Voight and William Fichtner as far as I am concerned, they very rarely do a bad movie and they do not disappoint here. George Kosturos as Ali is excellent and Ali Afshar as his uncle Hafez hits all the right notes.I am old enough to remember the 1980 hostage saga and Ronald Reagan being elected President, so it brings back a lot of memories.Very much worth watching and one I will be watching again, a suggestion for some would be to have the tissues handy.Very solid 8/10
