American Wrestler is yet another underdog sports movie, based on a true story. Ali Jahani escapes from Iran during the Iranian revolution and comes to a hostile USA, as racism against Iranians is rising due to the hostage crisis. Fitting in at a new school is difficult, he tries out for a team to fit in, sticks at wrestling and starts winning, gaining respect and being accepted.So, what makes this one worth watching? The lead performance by George Kosturos is extremely strong, portraying the different emotions Ali is feeling as he's making his way through. Jon Voight and William Fichtner also bring their characters to life and mostly well rounded.The script is also a strength for the most part. While there are some cringeworthy scenes (the school bully is overdone), in general the script keeps moving and is engaging. As noted, however, there are some down sides in some of the side characters, and in how believable some of the events are. The movie is clearly based on a true story, not a true story in itself.It's not a movie that has to be witnessed, but it shouldn't be ignored either.
