There are some reviews really ripping on the details on the film, and it is definitely a little formulaic. But it's got a very good cast, some good performances, a good soundtrack, and it overall an enjoyable movie. Some of the elements they try to incorporate to make it a little different than other sports films night not all work, but for a small film that I would guess didn't have a huge budget I think they did a very good job.
