The true story of a boy who escapes Iran to live with his uncle in California. Facing strife at home, school, and the community at large as the Iran hostage crisis was happening at the time; the young man attempts to fit in by joining a sports team. Eventually he lands on the wrestling team. Equal parts heartwarming and gut wrenching this movie is not to be missed. Worth the rental. Two thumbs up!
