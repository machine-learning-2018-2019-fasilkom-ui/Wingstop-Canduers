My Personal Rating - 6.8/10Obviously this documentary is made for Car People and it's purely focused about cars and their history. The ones that are interested behind the cars especially Koenigsegg that has interesting story behind them and it's founder and yes they are my most favorite Car Manafacturer in Automotive World. It also includes interviews with Chris Harris , Horacio Pagani which i found interesting too. It's just worth to watch it if you are interested in those person i mentioned.Pros:
<ul><li>Interesting Story Behind Koenigsegg </li><li>Decent Cinematography</li><li>Interviews From Chris Harris and Horacio Pagani and Christian Koenigsegg himself and more.</li></ul>
Cons:<ul><li>Only Focused On Car People </li><li>More Focused on Koenigsegg Than Other Manafacturers</li></ul>Rating On Each Aspect<ul><li>Cinematography: 7/10</li><li>Atmosphere: 6/10</li><li>Dialogue: 7/10</li></ul>
