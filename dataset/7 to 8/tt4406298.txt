I went on to check some of the credits of the women in this film after watching it and I came across a needlessly negative review, so I just wanted to offer my take.I've known actresses (or should I say actors?) in this business as well as casting directors and I hate to say this documentary has it right. It's especially rough for women in this business and I think it's good for people to see smart, articulate women speaking about their experiences. In a way it's hard to compare this to the previous film about male actors because I think this is about so much more.I guess I was bothered by the previous review I read because A) I actually think this is a better produced film than THAT GUY... and B) I think squashing the voices of some pretty impressive women working in this business by telling people not to see this is counterproductive. But that's what opinions are for, I suppose.Anyway, cheers to these women who have found peace and joy in being working actors, who know how lucky they are, even with all the challenges they've faced along the way.I kept thinking of Patricia Arquette at the Oscars while watching this. Did the filmmakers know she was going to give that speech?
