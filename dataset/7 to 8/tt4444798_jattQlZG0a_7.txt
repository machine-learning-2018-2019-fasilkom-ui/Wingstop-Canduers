Surprisingly low ratings for this movie as I thought it was an entertaining movie. Maybe the story has a couple flaws, things that we would all have done differently if we were in that situation, but mainly the story is interesting and keeps your attention during the entire movie. The main character is played by Dominik García-Lorido, so you get to see alot of her, and I thought she did a good job. Almost the entire movie is about her and that's a good thing. The rest of the cast was also good adding their parts to the story. Only Brock Kelly, that one I found to be weak acting, but not terrible. Maybe this story has been done before, probably, but nevertheless it was entertaining enough for me to have a good movie night.
