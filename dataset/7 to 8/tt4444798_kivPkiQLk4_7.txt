I felt compelled to write a review for this movie mainly because of the paranoid other review which had nothing really to do with the movie and was more about a political agenda.So, anyway... This film was well made I thought for a low budget film. The acting was ok The story, while not totally original was given a nice twist on a familiar premise. . Although I felt it gave the plot away a bit too early . Overall, I found it entertaining and worth watching.It deserves a higher rating than some have given it
