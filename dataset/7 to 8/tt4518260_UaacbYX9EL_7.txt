Surprisingly well acted family film. Excellent acting from John Cleese. Entertaining, magical plot which was moving in places. All in all very worth watching for all the family from youngsters to us older folk. We all really enjoyed it. This film speaks to the part of us that wishes to know that,'other' world in a similar way that many famous magical films do.
