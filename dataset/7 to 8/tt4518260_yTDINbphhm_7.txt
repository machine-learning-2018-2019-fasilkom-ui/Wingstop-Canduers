First off, the dialogue was hilarious and probably improvised on the fly with the help of John Cleese. It was very Pythonesc and fans of the Holy Grail would get a kick out of many of the scenes. Unfortunately, what the film needed was a faster pace and probably a more visionary director who could have taken this film to become the next Time Bandits. I did enjoy what I got, but couldn't help but see what this movie could have been.
