Here is a real life murder mystery of the Haysom's in Virginia back in the 80's. Elizabeth was a troubled college student with a drug problem.She met a German student named Jens Soring and her parents ended up hacked to death. They escaped to England but were brought back to the U.S. for trial. She pled guilty and through Jens under the bus. The courtroom footage is riveting, as the two tell very different stories of what happened that night. We all see things through our own personal viewpoints. As a true crime reader for over 30 years(The Stranger Beside Me), I was absorbed by this documentary. The only drawback is the missing Elizabeth, as she refused to be interviewed, but Jens loves to talk, and he makes for a great subject.
