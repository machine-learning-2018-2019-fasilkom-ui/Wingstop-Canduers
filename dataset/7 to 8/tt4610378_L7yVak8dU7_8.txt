In spite of huge interest in films/ documentaries that are build on sub-plots from WW2, I have watched very few in languages other than English. But Netflix was constantly reminding me about their recent addition so I finally gave it a go. And I am glad that I did. It is a serious film with very few light moments and that works quite well given the plot. Also without the background noise, so the movie speaks softly just like the bankers' mission. Understated but remarkable performances by many of the lead characters, particularly by Atsma and Derwig as the van Hall brothers. Best for the Oscars!
