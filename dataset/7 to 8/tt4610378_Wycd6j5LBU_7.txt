The story of Dutch banking employees financing the Resistance during the German occupation is a fascinating and inspiring one. I wish I could say as much for this movie. The acting was amazing, and the settings were very evocative. So was the general atmosphere pervading the underground's activities. But something was askew with the editing and/or the way in which the story unfolded. I had a lot of trouble following it especially during the middle section. I wasn't always clear on who were the good guys and who were the bad guys. I'm still glad I saw it, and would recommend it despite its shortcomings.
