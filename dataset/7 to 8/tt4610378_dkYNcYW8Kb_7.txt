I was born in Holland so watching this film was very rewarding. This film is quite good.Van Halls was one of thousands of WWII resistance heroes. This story is told from the unique perspective of how the Dutch resistance was financed by the heroic efforts of Wally Van Hall and his brother to fraud half a billion Euros out of the Dutch bank that had been taken over by Nazi Germany and funnel it to the resistance movement.The film shows the extent of these men and women's courage, as many were caught and many families torn apart as a consequence.Worthwhile film to see.
