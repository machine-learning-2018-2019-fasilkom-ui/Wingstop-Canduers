Hey folks,As an American and unable to speak any language other than English, I rarely watch any foreign films. The story itself did seem interesting, and when I found the film on Netflix was in English and included subtitles, I thought I would at least give it ten minutes or so to see if I would find it worth watching. While I knew none of the actors or others who produced this film, I did find the story to be quite captivating even though I did not understand the banking mechanics involved in financing the resistance. The acting was very good in my opinion, and I found I was able to navigate the story well enough with the English speech and subtitles. If one is expecting an action-adventure film, one would be better off skipping this film. On the other hand, if one can appreciate a well paced film that tells a very good story, then this film does that quite well. I have always loved a good story.Best wishes,
