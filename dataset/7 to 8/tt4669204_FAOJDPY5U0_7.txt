This uplifting documentary, directed by Dean Hargrove and running less than 1 hr. and 12 min., focuses on how tap dancing can indeed serve as an international "language". The film stresses the universality of this art form, as it crosses cultural, gender, race, and other barriers. Surprisingly, even in countries where I wouldn't expect to see tap dancing, such as Japan, Taiwan, and Brazil, it has gained popularity and recognition.There are many contributors to this movie, too numerous to mention, who share some of their individual stories, which often are remarkable and fascinating. One thing is for sure, they all share an immense passion for tap dancing, realizing they will never get rich from it, but not caring as long as they can continue to pursue it.The filmmakers are quite optimistic about future generations of tap dancers, citing they're adding new innovations, while still respecting its history and those artists that came before them.Overall, the energy and enthusiasm of the dancers across the globe is quite remarkable, and I found the talent of all, both young and old, to be rather amazing.
