I thought this movie was excellent. It doesn't tell a new tale, but it does it well with some genuine comedic moments. There's plenty of silly jokes to appeal to the 12 year olds and five year olds, and the animation is excellent. If this had been a Pixar/Disney movie, it would have got a far bigger distribution and promotional push than it got. This isn't the best animated film ever, but it's 85 minutes of fun with cute ducklings.
