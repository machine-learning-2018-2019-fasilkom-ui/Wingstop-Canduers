I almost stopped shortly after it started. The acting wasn't great, especially the secondary characters. The writing wasn't great. The camera work again wasn't great but the two main characters and the premise made me want to see where it went. I am glad I did. It was a good story with a good message. Even half way through I was thinking the whole movie was just going to be a pointless collapse but it took me along for a ride to a good conclusion. Don't go into this expecting big budget, award winning acting or writing but well worth watching to me.
