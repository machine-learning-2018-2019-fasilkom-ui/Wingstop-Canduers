I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from start to finish. It combined all the elements a true horror film possesses. I was able to connect with each character, and felt the suspense throughout. There's something to be said about a movie that keeps you guessing. I had no clue which direction the movie was heading, and I personally enjoy that in a horror movie. There are too many movies that are predictable in this day and age, and this was a breath of fresh air in that regards. I would definitely recommend this movie to friends and family who enjoy a good film.
