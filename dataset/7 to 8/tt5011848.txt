Let's start with the visuals, though I won't stop there. For a low budget movie this looks amazing. The special effects are really good. But it's not just "shiny" without substance. It does have a story it wants to tell and there is quite a bit to discover. I saw it at Frightfest and it was one of the highlights of the low budget movies that played there for me. Of course there were other voices and it's always a thing of taste and what bar you want to set for a movie.Does it have flaws? Could you criticize characters or some of the acting and the script/dialog? Yes, there is always room to critique something, even something many consider classics. I wouldn't go as far as calling this a classic (that's 9 or 10 for me), but for what it's worth and for the fact you can re-watch it and discover new things alone, this deserves the 8 fully. There are hidden messages and there obvious ones, that you will see through by just watching. And while not all questions will get an answer (not even from the director who was at Frightfest), it is for you to decide and decipher what you make of it. Stellar performances and a solid pace, make this a tense affair
