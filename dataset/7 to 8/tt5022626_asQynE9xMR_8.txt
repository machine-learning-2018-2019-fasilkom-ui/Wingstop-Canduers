One very interesting documentary about the role of food on our individual health.
When Humans disconnect from what they feed themselves we end up on the actual paradigm where the ones that have food don´t know how to eat it properly and the ones that yet know how don´t have what to eat.Worrying to say the least.Essential viewing for anyone interested in the theme.
