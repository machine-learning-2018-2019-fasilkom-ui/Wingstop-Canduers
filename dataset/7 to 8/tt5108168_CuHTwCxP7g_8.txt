I don't know what movie all the Negative Nancy's were watching, but from my seat the movie was a fun from the start military-zombie-science movie.
Sure there wasn't much character development, nor was the script all that deep. But it was an overall fun spin on our favorite theme. With great scenery, costumes, and just fine zombies. 
And speaking of the zombies, there was a nice twist or two. No spoilers. ;) 
Overall, it was fun to watch beginning to end. At the end my family was looking at me funny as I was yelling over and over a particular phrase. I was definitely invested. 
So of course it's not a big budget film that's going to win an Oscar. It's meant to be. It was created to be what it is. Pure zombie lover's enjoyment. And it absolutely delivers!
