Ok, it's not your top notch zombie movie, but who cares!!!! It was fun to watch. Yes the acting was not to good from some of the actors, but I love Joey Lawrence in anything he plays in!! I'm a big WWE fan and wanted to see Maryse Mizanin, she was pretty good, not a Jody foster but I enjoyed it. Some of the other actors were to over the top but all in all I just like zombie movies!!!! Call it a guilty pleasure! Lol
