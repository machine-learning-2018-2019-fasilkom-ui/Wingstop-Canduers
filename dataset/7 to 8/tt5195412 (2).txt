No, this movie is not like watching paint dry, it is about watching a person drop out and tune into the petty and superficial aspects of the self. Rather it's a "nervous breakdown" or not Cranston does wonders with his physiognomy and gait. No, this is not an action movie or a RomCom, but a study in character and psychology does require patience, as does sipping a good glass of wine, no need to gulp, enjoy the moments, the good and the bad.
