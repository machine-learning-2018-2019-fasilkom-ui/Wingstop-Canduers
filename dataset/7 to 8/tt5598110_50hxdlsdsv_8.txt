First of all, what a tremendous soundtrack this movie has. They use the color and the photography in a masterful way, giving a sense of suspense and intrigue to the plot. The performances are excellent and the atmosphere of the film makes it interesting and sad at the same time. Do not come looking for brutal scenes of fights and many shots, you will not find them. In the same way, I consider that the movie touches the subject of fetishism in a subtle and elegant way, giving a certain sense of interest to the plot. More than anything, the film knows how to touch the existential crises through which human beings cross and that sometimes we can not decipher, yes; accompanied by a soundtrack that makes the film go from 6 stars to 8.
