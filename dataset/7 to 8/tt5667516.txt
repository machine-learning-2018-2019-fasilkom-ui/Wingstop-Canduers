My wife selected this movie and I was initially skeptical due to the relatively unknown actors cast in this movie.I read the handful of reviews after watching it, and I was rather dismayed at the negative comments spread out before my eyes...all except for one review that was in total accord with my impressions of this film. Since all but one review seemed to reflect what I had experienced in this movie, I decided to post a review myself...for the very first time on IMDb. Yes, the actors are relatively unknown for I could not even name one from memory. Nevertheless, they managed to create an action-packed movie that kept me riveted to the chair from start to finish. The main characters all demonstrated widely differing personalities that were easily distinguishable. Somehow, you were drawn to each one - more or less. If you wish to relish the story, avoid over-analyzing the details and simply sit back and enjoy the action-packed ride.Give it a shot....it's truly worth watching!
