The movie's story has been well thought of ; the plight of villagers specially women who have to defacate in open has been portrayed in a realistic manner. The problem of not having toilets at home isn't an ordinary one. A major reason for rising number of rapes in rural areas is that women have to go out in the open fields and defacate. The toilet scams, lack of awareness and the unwillingness of people in villages to change their old notions are a real problem. The movie has some songs and romantic scenes which unnecessarily increase its time duration, the jokes aren't funny enough to make you laugh but Akshay Kumar definitely holds your interest throughout. The second half is more informative and happening. In short, you may go and watch this movie with your family or friends over the weekend.
