I certainly wasn't expecting much from a Lifetime movie about women trying to find romance. Not exactly an original topic to make a movie out of, right? However, the cast was perfect for this film and the writing was fresh and clever. It takes a lot for me to actually laugh out loud but this film had me cracking up quite a bit. Kellee Stewart really stood out. She walked the fine line between catty and sensitive with perfection.It also impressed me with how it handled relationships and sexuality. It is obvious from reading a few of the childish reviews here that people still have a lot of growing up to do. To this day, many insist that there is no such animal as a bisexual man. They are all supposedly gays 'in denial'. Sheer ignorance. "Love by the 10th Date" handled that stereotype head on in a realistic and poignant fashion.If you want a fresh take on trying to find love in the modern age, then I highly recommend watching this film.
