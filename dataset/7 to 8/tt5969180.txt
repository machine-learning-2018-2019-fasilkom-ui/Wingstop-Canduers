There's not much to write about this movie. Very simple story with a predictable ending. Each character has a charm to keep you entertained and the pace moving.A sweet story of a successful author discovering an element within himself when a forgotten encounter comes back to interrupt his otherwise perfect life.By the way - the authors house is a must see!
