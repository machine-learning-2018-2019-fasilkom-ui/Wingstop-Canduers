This movie was really interesting to me. I enjoyed watching how students can challenge each other in the classroom to become more physically literate. They actually enjoy the exercises. As for the coaches, they reward students with the shorts program and I really love that. It gives a goal for the students to achieve and a sense of pride once they get it.
