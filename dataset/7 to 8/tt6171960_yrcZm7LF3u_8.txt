Todrick Hall is one of my favorite YouTubers so I had to see his documentary. It was so entertaining and fun and it showed all the challenge and struggles he faced trying to make his album and when he went on tour. He is such a hard worker and you see that in this documentary. He is so inspiring and he encourages so many people to be themselves and to never let bully's take you down. I love his Straight Outta Oz album and the video he made for it on YouTube. It's so creative and inspiring. I would definitely recommend watching this documentary if you're a fan of his.
