While this is not a great movie, it was funny enough. If you're only going for Kate McKinnon, her role is small but choice. But the main cast was also solid. Well worth watching.But take a closer look at the user reviews. Funny thing -- all of the 1 star reviews were posted on the same day. It looks to me like a bunch of haters got together and vomited their bile on this movie.
