Forget everything you know about Journey to the West novel cause Wu Kong here is a complete rewrite the origin of Sun Wukong the number one Chinese folk heroes with a much more darker tone and it surprise the hell out of me.The CGI fight is very good,the characters is likable and the dark elements really shine when it bring actual emotion to the audience.i'm not sure is it the best movie about Sun Wukong but at the meantime it the most interesting one
