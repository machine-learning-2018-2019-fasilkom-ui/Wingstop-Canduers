Mary Kay Place (Diane) gives a performance so real that we think we know her, have likely run into her at the grocery store or maybe met her at a local civic group. In any case we'd walk by this 'unremarkable' older woman with barely a glance. Her life is easy, hard, stressful, comfortable -- filled with things that matter only to her and her close family and friends. She is "every-woman" and yet Place inhabits Diane so well that we are drawn into the depth of her 'everyday' life and realize how extraordinary an ordinary life really is. Kent Jones does a brilliant humanistic directing job. A group of veteran actors (Joyce Van Patten and Estelle Parsons to name two) well known from stage and television, fill out a great ensemble cast. Thank you Kent Jones. A true pleasure.
