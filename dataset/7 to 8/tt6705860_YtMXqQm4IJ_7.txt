'Diane', a character-driven study of a woman coming to grips with her past life choices, aging, loss of friends and family, and most importantly, her ongoing struggle to relate to her drug-addicted son, ws featured at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival. Mary Kay Place (remember her from the TV series 'Mary Hartman Mary Hartman', or movies 'Being John Malkovich' and 'The Big Chill'?), is quite good as the title character and is in virtually every seen of the movie, which, according to director Kent Jones in a post-viewing Q&amp;A, was filmed in 20 days and has won Best Narrative at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival. Diane spends the movie always reaching out to others with a helping hand but just cannot seem to grasp the idea that she needs, via those that she helps, to focus inward at times and be at peace with herself and her choices. It is a very interesting movie with several great performances, but at times leaves the viewer scratching their head about timeline, certain images, and seemingly non-congruent scenes, but overall a very good study of a flawed human. By the way...the name Diane is derived from Diana, goddess of the hunt, childbirth, and the forest-very appropriate for the movie's character.
