A documentary exploring the life and career of notorious Republican dirty trickster and longtime Trump adviser, Roger Stone, who helped create the real-estate mogul's political career.As I write this (June 2017), Donald Trump is the president of the United States. Despite polls to the contrary, he won the election and has taken the reins with his unique style of governing. How did this happen? Where did Trump come from? Although Roger Stone has been around since Watergate, his name may not be all that well known beyond those who are into political minutia. Here, we see how he was behind Nixon, Reagan, Trump and more, with a blend of dirty tricks, and conservative libertarianism. How the far right has become mainstream slowly but surely.I can only wait until the FBI files on Stone someday become public... and then we will see that not only was he involved in much of American political history, but perhaps much of the secret history as well. The last word on Watergate is yet to come.
