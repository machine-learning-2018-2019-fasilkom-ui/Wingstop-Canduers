Roger Stone in one of America's worst people. He started out doing dirty tricks for Nixon; he made his money as a lobbyist for some terrible governments; now he's a confidant of Donald Trump. In a healthy society, Stone (and any politican who worked with him) would be shunned. This account of his story is consistently fascianting, and a tale of much of what has gone wrong with American politics.And yet, although the documentary is critical in tone, I suspect Stone loves it. A man who revels in his own notoriety, he is given plenty of screen time to speak for himself; while numerous others, friend and foe alike, take turns to testify to his evil genius. For anyone who dislikes the man, there's plenty of grist to the mill here. But how do you shame the shameless? Not, perhaps, by allowing them to star what is essentially a 90 minute promo vehicle. The real tragedy is less that people like Stone exist; but that we allow them to polllute the public space.
