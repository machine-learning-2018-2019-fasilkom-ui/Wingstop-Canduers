I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. With a surprising amount of heart, The Week Of blends in some truly heartfelt performances with a very funny script. I had myself quite a few chuckles throughout the duration of the movie.There's also a story. We haven't seen that in an Adam Sandler film for a while.I'm giving this one an A- or an 8/10 on IMDb
