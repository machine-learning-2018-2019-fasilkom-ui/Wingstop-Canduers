Having come across this film in need of a light afternoon watch, I watched the film with the expectation of cheesy, lighthearted comedy with some generic moral to the story; I wasn't too far off. However, I was incredibly surprised by how much I found myself laughing! The script in my opinion was terrifically written and there were some very relatable and convincing character performances.I am quite disappointed by the mass of poor reviews for this film, no it is not a classic nor is it the most witty but it is a very fun, lighthearted, and warm watch. After all, what would you expect from a film that stars Adam Sandler and Chris Rock!In my humble opinion, well worth a watch for a lazy afternoon.
