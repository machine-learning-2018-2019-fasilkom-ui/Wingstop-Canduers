This movie was really enjoyable to me...I think some parts could of landed better...but I also think that people with dogs who are considered to be apart of their family will eat this movie up...I love movies like this...where you feel apart of the families lives...reminded me of being young and my sister and I having our cat...he was 14 when he was put down...that's a big part of you...a big part of your life...hard when you have to let that go...this family was so in sync with one another...so many laughs that really seem genuine...check this out...watch a movie that makes you feel like things still matter that aren't tragedies...there are still things to make you smile in this world...things that make you cry...but those things are what make you who you are...
