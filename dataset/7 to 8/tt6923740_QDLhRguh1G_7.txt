In this era of big sci-fi, super hero movies (which I love btw), this movie is a breath of fresh air. Awesome &amp; realistic acting &amp; chemistry between the real life brothers. Supporting characters are good as well, including "Stella"!! I laughed &amp; cried as the story progresses! I was totally invested in the screenplay. Definitely recommended :)
