Independent film is enjoyable because it can tell stories the big studios wouldn't. Elephants is one of those stories, flawed characters who owe their shortcomings to the accumulation of small mistakes, rather than flashy dramatic traumas.Effective performances help elevate the characters, and the story moves along at a good pace. Definitely recommend!
