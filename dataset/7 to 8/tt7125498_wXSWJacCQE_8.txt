I've seen this movie a bunch of times at this point and I think I've developed a pretty good understanding of it. It is a great romantic movie filled with comedy and drama. The love story while told before has been recreated in a way that definitely makes this film stand apart. My biggest tip as a viewer to get the most enjoyment out of the film is to always try to spot the Elephant in the room. Both physically and within the characters... the more times you watch it the more you see deeper into the characters and how the elephant analogy applies. Hands down the sister relationship is so freaking accurate. That pregnant girl takes the cake everytime! Even as a person who doesn't have a sister old enough to connect with in this way I related when thinking about certain friendships I've shared. All in all it's a great film the only reason I didn't give it 10 stars was because of the occasional continuity error and the lack of clarity in the "Egg Scene" (No spoilers but if your going to use a metaphor...) it took me until around the 5th time watching it that I figured out the purpose of that scene. However, I still recommend you watch this movie! (And I don't do that often.)
