This film is about the triple Olympic champion in figure skating, and film star Sonja Henie. Sonja Henie is one of the most famous Norwegian people ever. The story of her is therefore challenging to get filmed, since her life was both complex and contains both a brilliant sports career and in the field of film / entertainment. The director of this film has chosen the focus one-sided on the movie star Henie. This has been criticized, but I think it's a good choice. The director had to make a choice.
The film takes us along with Henie to Hollywood, where she is quickly offered to make big money on ice shows and eventually movies. The figure skating career has made her known. It's a huge success, which the film manages to bring out very well. The film depicts Henie as both a great diva, who treated all those around her as objects she could use for what she wanted from them. In this film she is presented both as cold and calculating, and without the ability to empathize with both family members and employees. What I was wondering during the movie was what was her underlying motivation to do as she did, and make the choices she made? But anyway, she became the best-paid female actor in Hollywood, and toured with her shows for sold out venues in the United States. The film takes time to bring us into this genre and era, and it is done on a very good and convincing way.
Ine Marie Wilmann is brilliant as Henie in this movie. Wilman manages to present sides to Henie as a tough, hard-core business woman. I was thinking after this movie, that Henie might have been ahead of time, when it, as a woman, came to negotiating good contracts and deals. Anyway, this is a great movie, and anyone who is excited about biographical films will benefit from it, and at the same time learn a lot about one of Norway's most famous women ever.
