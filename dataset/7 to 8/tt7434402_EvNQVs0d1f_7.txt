I stumbled upon this quirky gem, I wish it was a full length movie. With that being said, it was perfect for the allotted time. A to-the-point cabin horror flick, with a very nice twist. Its low budget, but the score and acting are done well. Worth watching for those underground horror fans who need a quick fix. 7 stars for great plot and acting, just wanted it to be further developed!
