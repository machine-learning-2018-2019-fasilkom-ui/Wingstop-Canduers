This is a film which is spoiled by the director itself by worst screenplay. The concept is really good, but unnecessary songs like lover also, iraga iraga &amp; adding heavy commercial values and dull climax killed the film. Only thing which is good in this film is Allu Arjun's brilliant portrayal of Surya an angry soldier. He made the movie bearable.
