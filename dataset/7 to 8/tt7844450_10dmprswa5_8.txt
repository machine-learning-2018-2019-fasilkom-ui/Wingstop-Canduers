The World Before Your Feet was well-received in its world premiere at Austin's SXSW Film Festival. It is the strange story of 37-year-old Matt Green who dropped out of normal life to begin a project of walking approximately 8000 miles of every street, park, beach and cemetery in New York City. He has chosen to be intentionally homeless - staying with different friends - so as to pursue some sort of massive performance art project of exploring and photographing every block of the massive city. The documentary is beautifully filmed and really is, in part, a tribute to the beauty and complexity of the organism that is that most remarkable and complicated city. The film is entertaining and beautiful. The central conundrum of Mark Green's journey is never really answered. I get the feeling that Green is either running away or running towards something, or perhaps a little bit of both. I'm not sure he really understands his own "Forrest Gump"-like journey. I hope the walker eventually finds the direction he wants to travel with his life. Perhaps the film maker should have asked some questions about Green's mental condition since his behavior seems to be somewhat irrational. Recommended for those open to the highly unconventional.
