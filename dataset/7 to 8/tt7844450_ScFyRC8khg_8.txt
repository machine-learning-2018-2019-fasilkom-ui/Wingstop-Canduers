In case you needed definitive proof how *safe it is in New York City in this decade, look no further. This doesn't have necessarily the most top notch or artistically ambitious direction (the cute score and reliance, maybe over-reliance, on drones for those BIG shots), but damn if this isn't one of themost fascinating documents of the human spirit in a long time. You learn enough about the guy, Matt Green, to understand but at the same time not fully understand why he's doing this. That may sound off, but you don't need to know his full back story; a few key details about a younger brother, a bike accident, and two ex's are enough.What makes it a subject worthy of cinematic exploration is really just... Seeing him walk. Sometimes he interacts and talks with the locals, other times he tells us a fact about something, like a tree that is the oldest in New York City, or landmarks in cemeteries that we take for granted or even the first birth control center from 1910's. Like the Mister Rogers documentary this year, the movie is really about human connectivity and how , if you're open to what's out there and are genuinely curious, the World isn't such a bad place.* at least if you are white and man, but still I think my points can still be valid here.
