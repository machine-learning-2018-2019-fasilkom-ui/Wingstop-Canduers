The beginning of the movie was really promising. Casting was great, people who were cast as the gang members were amazing, David Castañeda did an amazing job portraying Rincon. JCVD l, even though he didn't appear much in the first half, did a great job as well.
The biggest problem was the camera man. Almost every shot was shaky and after a while, you couldn't ignore it anymore. I do understand that the budget was very low, but it's not hard to shoot scenes with steady camera.
Also Elijah Rodriguez, in my opinion, was missing emotions needed in certain scenes.
The ending wasn't that great as well. They could make it a little longer or add a few scenes. A little more action couldn't hurt too
However, considering how low the budget was, they did a good job with the movie.
