REVIEW - WE DIE YOUNGVan Damme is back!I've waited a long time to say that and mean it, recently he's been in some quite poor films but......Set in Washington DC 20 minutes from the White House in a deprived area this story follows 2 kids trying to escape the drug filled neighbourhood, but reading this you may think this film is yet another run of the mill film of kids trying to escape the hood but wow, the human story, the characters (even the man who runs the neighbourhood), the twists and turns and the whole story arch brings this whole film to life, so much so you feel and care for the characters.Van Damme shines in this film without opening his mouth once (no spoilers). Thoroughly enjoyed this film from start to surprising finish which I even didn't see coming, respect to the writers!More story than Van Dammes usual films and certainly one to see.Rating 8 out of 10
