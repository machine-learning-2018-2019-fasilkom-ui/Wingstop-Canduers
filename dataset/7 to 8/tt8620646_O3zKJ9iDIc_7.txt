I am surprised by the low ratings and the bad reviews it got. After watching An Affair To Die For I think this movie clearly deserves a higher rating. To me it was an entertaining movie, a story with alot of twists and turns, some that you see coming and some that you don't, but overal there is a constant suspense hanging throughout the movie. I doubt this could happen in real life but that doesn't matter to me. When I watch a movie like this one I want to be entertained, and that's exactly what I got, entertainment. The acting was okay expect for Claire Forlani. She just doesn't have it to be a good actress so that was the minor point to me. A good little thriller worth watching.
