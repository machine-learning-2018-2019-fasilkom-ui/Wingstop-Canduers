I have already watched about 20 Christmas movies this year, so I have seen the good the bad and fugly. This is a winner. I enjoyed the cast very much. The actors were quite good and natural. The kids were good too. It is nice to see different actors and people I do not see usually, in a holiday movie. Tatyana Ali , whom I have never seen or heard of before is very charismatic and charming. This is the third holiday movie I have watched in the last two weeks featuring her. ( I am watching some older ones, I had never heard of before). I loved the song they ended up with at the end. I would totally add that song to my holiday play list, if I can find it anywhere. Yes the plot was the same girl goes back to hometown plot, but this is like comfort food. The difference between a good one of these movies and a horrible one, is the actors, the production values and no plot holes. Yes the snow looked fake, but so far that is true in almost all of the ones I have been watching. Why do they never film these in the actual snow? I guess real snow gets muddy, wet and ugly with an entire movie crew working on it. Good job. This is an enjoyable feel good movie. Good family movie, or movie to have playing in the background while you go about your holiday prep. Merry Christmas!
