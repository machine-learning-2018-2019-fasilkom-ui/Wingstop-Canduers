The premise of this movie is almost exactly like at least one other Christmas movie and very similar to several others. It had the potential to sink into obscurity. But after 2/3rds or so there is an interesting twist that puts a different take on the story. Unfortunately, after that other overused tropes sneak back into the story so it ends up in the same place, but what else can you expect when there are only so many possible outcomes.Most of the acting is solid. The leads have a chemistry as they revisit their past. There is some good solid soul searching by those same characters.Sometimes it's hard to judge the quality of acting when humor is involved especially if the humor is exaggerated. In this case though, I think it's definitely true that Loretta Devine, as the unethical boss, has some horrible acting moments.The movie includes performance of some traditional Christmas songs by a youth choir and one of an original song by the leads.
