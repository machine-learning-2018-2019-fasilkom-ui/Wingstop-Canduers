you won't believe your eyes! stunts! rock! it's the new style! these people really thought they were onto something here, and their earnestness, regardless of talent, helps elevate the whole film. there is no plot to speak of, although a few tangental storylines keep things moving more or less ahead. but really it's all an excuse to get from musical sequence to stunt sequence and back again. over and over and over. every moment is unbelievably absurd and surreal. many of the stunt sequences are spliced in from other films the star, Grant Page, has performed stunts in. he plays himself, as do many of the other actors and musicians here, including the amazingly awful sorcery, whose live performances, as shown here, are filled with an audience who seem to all be wondering who the hell these people are. besides this, there's a masked keyboardist! stunts painfully gone awry! chicks in gold spandex with guns! wizards! demons! 10 out of 10! especially good as a double feature with Dolemite or The Song Remains The Same. PS: a few years ago a friend had a bachelor party in which he and his buddies dressed up as Sorcery and actualy learned and played the entire soundtrack to the film. Even better was that the director, Brian Trenchard-Smith showed up and videotaped it!
