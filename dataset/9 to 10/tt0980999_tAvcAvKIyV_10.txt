This movie is one you cannot stop watching! Four people - three males one female - on one July 4th evening. Joe - a middle aged successful college professor who puts on a cheerful front but inside he is torn apart. June - a teenage boy confused and seeking to find himself and realizing the fear it brings. Abigayle - the daughter of Joe, she is beautiful, intelligent, responsible, but she is seeking to fulfill her physical desires without betraying herself. Dexter - he is young, very attractive (and he knows it), overly confident, a dropout, and he only wants what he can from Abigayle.Director: Joshua Sanchez weaves this 4th of July story together in such a way you easily become emotionally involved with each one. There is tension and suspense. You will be wondering is there danger for June. Will Abigayle be a victim. Why is Joe, who seems so pleasant and with so much to loose, doing what he's doing. And Dexter he's the wild card because he seems tender but volatile.At movies end Joshua Sanchez leaves the book open on each character. What's to happen with Abigalye and her discovery. Who did June call with the cell phone - was it Todd - I got that impression. Dexter gets what he wants but will Abigalye drop him. And Joe, I felt sorry for him, he will eventually have to face up to his family but he hasn't realized it yet.If you care for movies about the human condition of just living and needing and how some seek to satisfy this need then FOUR is the film for you. It's a wonderful achievement in acting, direction, plot, etc.
