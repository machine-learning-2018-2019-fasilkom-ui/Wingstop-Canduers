Great film. Glad I watched, and enjoyed the suspense! A must watch. Always great to get a chance to support the indie genre. If you like a road trip movie, turned horror, this will be the perfect match. The acting is what you expect for this genre, while still keeping the story alive. Well... almost alive... And don't forget, it has Cathy Baron who everyone loves from Justified. I was able to rent it easily on amazon, and just have a late night thrill. It is shot well, but pretty traditional for the build up to the "shock" moments, but that is what you expect. Editorial also falls in line with the genre. I would recommend this film if you enjoy a simple story, with the right kind of horror.
