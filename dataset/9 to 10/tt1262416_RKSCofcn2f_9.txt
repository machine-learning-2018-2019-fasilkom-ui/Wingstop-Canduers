To the younger generations of movie reviewers: Take the stick out of your ass before watching this movie! Thank you.Scream is Wes Craven territory. It's comedy-horror, it's suppose to be twisted fun and that's what this is. Unlike the 3rd film, this didn't try to insult our intelligence with over-the-top gags and an overly serious ending. This film stayed very true to the first two films and yet, at the same time, did not feel like just another sequel. Having the ten years between really made this a one of a kind, intimate experience with these three unforgettable characters. The fear for their lives was as real as the first time we met Sidney, Gale and Dewey.The entire films was and stayed tongue in cheek and for a sequel, it was just as refreshing as the original.Hands down to directors like Sam Raimi, Robert Rodriquez and Wes Craven, for making horror movies fun!
