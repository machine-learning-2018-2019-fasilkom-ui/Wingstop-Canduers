Goosebumps and chills will overcome you as you attempt to unravel the identity of the Ghostface killer. But "he unexpected is the new cliché'", so don't try to analyze it, just sit back and enjoy the ride. There are twists, there are turns, and only one things is certain: you better be ready to scream.
