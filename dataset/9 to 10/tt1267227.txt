The director introduce the viewers the background of a few selected racers, their struggle against cancer, diabetes, alcohol, etc. Then he sets them against each others as if it was the challenge of their life. He assembled pictures from many perspectives, aerial shots to details like the socks on the dog's paws. The director explain well the difficulties and the dangers of the race with interviews with the mushers during and after the race. The camera bring the viewer through numerous small villages in Alaska, places where most humans would never go.The picture quality (night and day) are excellent. Pictures angle from the dog's sled, still camera, close ups, landscape, the mountains, etc. I watched all the episodes twice in a row.
