I saw the world premier last night at the Birmingham Michigan Uptown Film Festival.This is a terrific documentary that enthralled everyone present. Many in this country do not know enough about the history of the labor movement and what unions did to establish a middle class in this country. I would love to see this movie on PBS and I believe it will be used in classrooms at the high school and college levels.First person interviews and archival footage bring this period of our history to life. Of interest, the Ted Kennedy interview were among the last he gave before his death.
