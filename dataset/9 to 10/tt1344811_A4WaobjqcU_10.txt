Sasha Reuther's beautifully created documentary "Brothers on the Line" depicts an important part of American history oft forgotten or neglected. Charged with passion for the social justice topics it covers, the documentary is as much a personal journey for this Reuther as it is a critical and unbiased assessment of the contributions of the UAW, and its leaders - his grandfather Victor Reuther, and grand uncles Walter and Roy. The rare archival material, the music, story-telling and the narration by Martin Sheen, further transform this brilliant film, making it an engaging and moving documentary - one that viewers will always remember.
