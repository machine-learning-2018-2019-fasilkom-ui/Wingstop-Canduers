Great film for those interested in labor and civil rights history in the U.S. in the 20th century. As a retired UAW member I had the privilege over the year of meeting a few of the people in the film, Victor Reuther, Doug Frasier, and Jerry Tucker. I certainly hope it gets to be on PBS as it is important historically to our country. Thank you Sasha Reuther for making this valuable contribution to documenting some of our history. I saw the film on May 5, 2012 in Chicago at the Labor Notes Conferece. I hope to some day be able to purchase it for my local union library in Three Rivers, Michigan. It is unfortunate that the UAW itself turned it's back on Victor Reuther in the 1980's when he challenged some of the actions of those that inherited the movement he and his brothers had built.
