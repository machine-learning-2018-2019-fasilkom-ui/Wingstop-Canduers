The impact of the Reuther family on the history and social development of the United States and the world can not be overstated. "Brothers On The Line" documents not only the time line of their challenges and important events, but it also provides a window into the character of the men, women and organizations that formed the heart of the America's labor movement. With Martin Sheen's narration, Natalie Merchant's searing rendition of the Union call to arms, "Which side Are You On?", the movie revisits vital landmarks in the development of the labor movement. The means for attaining a lifestyle that we have come to label "middle class" was gained for millions upon millions of workers here and abroad by the Reuthers and others via the monumental struggles with the industrial giants of their time. The film captures the progression of those struggles, the benefits to workers everywhere and the courage of those willing to lay it all on the line in the name of fair and humane treatment for all. Brothers On The Line measures up to any historical documentary and will stand the test of time as an important document in the tableau of American history.
