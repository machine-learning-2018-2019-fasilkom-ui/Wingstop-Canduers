A great movie. This should be shown to every school child. Workers died to form unions, and we are letting that sacrifice go so easily. The Ford Service Department and thug union busters that tried to kill the Reuther Brothers have been replaced by think tanks, PACs and Republicans. Unions have been on the right side of social history; from Civil Rights to health care.Martin Sheen does a great job as narrator. The archival footage was great, and it was blended well with present day interviews. A great job of storytelling of a story far too many people have forgotten.I have seen it twice, and it holds my interest every time.
