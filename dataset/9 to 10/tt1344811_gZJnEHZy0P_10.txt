i saw brothers on the line last night at the DC film fest. having been raised in Detroit in a family active in both the labor and civil rights movement, i was very very excited to see brothers on the line. so often, i see movies that depict part of Detroit's history and exploit both the economic and political failure that have plagued our hometown since the 60s. this film was one of the few that did the complex and confounding history with respect and insight! it was a fantastic mix of archival footage and original interviews, well paced, well shot and a real pleasure to watch! i was particularly pleased with the inclusion of DRUM and the honesty with which Sasha Reuther engaged the personal and political it was an exceptional biopic and also so much more! an amazing movie at such a critical time!
