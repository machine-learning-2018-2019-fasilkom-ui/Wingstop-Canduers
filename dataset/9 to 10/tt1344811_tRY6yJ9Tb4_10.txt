I have watched this most inspirational and important documentary several times now, and at every sitting, I have noticed something new and fascinating that had never struck me before. It only serves to show the versatility of this film and its successful marriage of archival footage with current-day clips. The pacing and music were excellent, but most riveting is the story line itself. It offers a unique historical perspective on the country's labor movement, its triumphs and troubles, while shedding a contemplative light on the labor movement in general today. It also left me thinking and wishing that labor leaders were viewed in a more heroic light - given their ultimate sacrifice and dedication to the cause of social justice. Brothers On The Line was truly enjoyable and incredibly exhilarating.
