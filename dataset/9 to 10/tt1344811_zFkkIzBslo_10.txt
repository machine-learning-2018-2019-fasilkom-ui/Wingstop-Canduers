An educational and inspirational film on organized labor and the immense good that unionism has done for improving the lives of the working class in America.Hopefully this documentary will serve to educate a new generation on the positive influence which unions in general, and more specifically, the UAW, has had in building the middle class and serving as a powerful vehicle for civil rights and social justice.This is not so much a reaffirmation of a forgotten or lost history, but rather a new shining of the light of truth on a history which has been slandered, disparaged and lied about by the powerful and corrupting influence of corporate money and thirty plus years of intentional anti-union misinformation in all areas of public discourse.Its time to stop the lies, time to fight back against the corporate culture of greed and exploitation which is threatening the economic prosperity of this nation, destroying the middle class and once again squeezing the life out of the working poor.We can change our economic course...we did it before...the Reuther Brothers and the UAW are a testament to that...and we can do it again. We just have to organize and work together in a spirit of common cause and solidarity for the betterment of all, not just the privileged few, for the nation as a whole and not just those who live behind mansion gates paid for by the exploited labor of America's hard working men and women.
