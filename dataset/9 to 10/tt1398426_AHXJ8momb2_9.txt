Ignore all the 1-star reviews because the people posting them are total losers. You can tell by their vapid criticisms. Too graphic, gimme a break. Semi-pornographic, really? There were a few scenes with nudity, far from gratuitous unless you consider all nudity gratuitous. As for violence, there was barely any hard-core violence, certainly not enough to distract from the main storyline. Quite simply, if you loved the music, you'll love the movie. Solid acting and solid script. I'm not sure how historically accurate it is, but that's beside the point. It's a movie, not a documentary. To those who continue to spout their bile about this film, get a life. No one cares about your pathetic moralizing and thinly veiled racism.
