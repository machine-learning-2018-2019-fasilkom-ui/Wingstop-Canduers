Very well told story based on the widely performed Langston Hughes play, Black Nativity. The music, acting and story captured me in a way I wouldn't have expected. I loved Jennifer Hudson's singing and Jacob Latimore's acting. He's one to watch in the future. And where did Grace Gibson come from? Fantastic acting from Forest Whitaker, Angela Basset and Mary Blige. The story line is intentionally unreal but beautifully matches the spirit of the season. As an upper middle class white Jewish guy, with nothing directly in common with these characters, I was moved and completely absorbed by this movie. I'd recommend it for every one of all ages. Take your kids, you'll have something good to talk about.
