Let me first say that I believe Frank John Hughes and Rick Gomez to be two of the truly underrated actors in Hollywood, to say nothing of the fact that they were also responsible for producing and writing this masterpiece. I'd watch anything the two of them put out. Frank John Hughes could have held his own in this film with his eyes alone. He is brilliant. Rick Gomez plays his role to perfection, using his signature blend of sarcasm &amp; dry humor, mixed with an incredibly heart-wrenching display of raw emotion. His versatility makes him one of the best kept secrets in Hollywood. LEAVE is a film that I can watch over and over again, regardless of the fact that I already know the ending.
