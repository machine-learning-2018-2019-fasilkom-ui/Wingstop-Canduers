This is the kind of exploration that Ingmar Bergman and Terrence Malick (at his best) used to create.It is a work of art, an absolute gem.Every element of this film works seamlessly...to generate a flood of feelings and memories in the viewer.Please be prepared: this beautiful movie may reach you on some deep levels. The way that ALL great art usually does.
