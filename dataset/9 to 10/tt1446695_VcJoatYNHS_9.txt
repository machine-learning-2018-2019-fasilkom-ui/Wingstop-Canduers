As the ending credits began to roll on LEAVE, I sat there in stunned silence. Overwhelmed by the story that had just unfolded in front of me. The storyline, though gripping and thrilling from beginning to end, was only one part of this movie. Like a single actor delivering their lines. Director Robert Celestino brought me so deep and immersed into this tale, that the journey became personal and it became mine. Stand out performances by Rick Gomez as our troubled writer and Frank John Hughes as the mysterious stranger who enters his world, had me on edge throughout the entire picture. However, it was the cinematography and most importantly the sound that were the real feature stars of this film. Together, they knitted a subconscious fabric throughout the movie, which was so subliminal, that every scene, no matter how benign, still had me feeling a sense of ominous terror. Bringing all of these elements together and delivering a stunning payoff at the end, made this film a terrific, yet terrifying treat. LEAVE is a film that crosses the line from story telling to cinematic experience. Few films have the dramatic power to do that, but LEAVE, will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.
