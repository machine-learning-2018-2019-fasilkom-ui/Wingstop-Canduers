The pieces are all there, and every viewer can construct their own paradigm of family memories, joys, sorrows...this is a very personal movie, and a work of art.It's the sort of powerful exploration that Ingmar Bergman and (at his best) Terrence Malick used to make.The reviewer before me was correct...I cannot fully discuss this movie without spoiling it. You simple have to see it. I can say this: please be prepared for a flood of memories and feelings, which this film will awaken in you.
