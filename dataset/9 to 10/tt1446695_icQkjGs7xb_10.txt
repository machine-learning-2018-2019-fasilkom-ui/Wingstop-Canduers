I am 61 years old, rented this movie, hoping it wasn't a "yawner." Well, I was not disappointed. I loved every minute of it. But don't leave the room to get some popcorn or coke without putting it on "pause." You will miss something important. The acting was great and the plot kept me guessing throughout the entire movie. I went from happy to sad to happy to sad to scared for the main character to happy for the main character. I want my sister to watch this movie and my daughter and my sons and my grandchildren. So few movies have such substance. I loved some of the lines from the movie but won't do any spoilers here. Just watch it!
