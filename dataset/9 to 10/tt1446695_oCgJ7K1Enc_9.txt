Just as a sign of how much this film moved me, this is my first review on IMDb after 3 years of not having much to add or say about countless other movies.As other reviewers have written, it's tough to talk about "Leave" without spoiling it.The best I can do is recommend you read the synopsis, perhaps watch the trailer and make up your own mind. Don't fall for the abysmal ratings on IMDb. You can leave and dismiss it as I almost did or stay and be surprised. Do what you want.You have a choice. One minute into the film and I wasn't sure if this was for me. I chose to let go and enjoy the trip. Turns out this was just what I needed.I'd describe it as a slow paced psychological thriller. It's a short movie and it's perfect as it is.I can say I've watched this twice in a row and I'm still thinking about it. I cannot recommend this enough.
