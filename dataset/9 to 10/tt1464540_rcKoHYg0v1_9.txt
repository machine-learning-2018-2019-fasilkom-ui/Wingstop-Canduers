Read some of the reviews on here so was unsure what to make of this. But loved the movie and was surprised how well it rolled. The special effects were superb as were the action scenes. Not sure why some slammed this movie but I have no problem giving this a 9. If your looking for a good weekend movie slouching on the couch eating pizza then this is the business!If your a sci fan such as myself then this is a watchable movie very watchable. I was worried that the relationship between the main character and the photographer would run away with itself and overtake the plot as is seen is so many decent movies ruined by pointless teen relationships. But I Am Number 4 did not let this happen and it glued with the plot really well. The fight scenes were well scripted and did not go on for too long. Get the popcorn out sit back and enjoy this scifi flick I don't think you will be disappointed.
