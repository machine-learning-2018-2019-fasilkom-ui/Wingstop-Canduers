I love this movie, really good dry humor. Don't listen to the whiners. Favorite line, "I apologize for my role in the malfeasance in the pool last night.". the movie is filled with ridiculous situations, a insurance salesman conference in a conference center covered with cheap wooden wall paneling. The star wears nerdy looking turtleneck brown sweaters. Some of the funniest movie lines I've heard "..oh I see your eatin' the canned tuna from the bottom shelf.". All the insurance salesmen (and women) are waaay to excited to be at the "ASMI" conference, it is obviously the highlight of their life. Dirty sexcrets everywhere underneath the blanket of these godly insurance salespeople. I can't think of a comedy like it, it builds on you.
