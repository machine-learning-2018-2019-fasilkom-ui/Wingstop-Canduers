This is a brilliant documentary about a largely hidden history (for north Americans, that is) about the savage violence they suffered under a dictatorship Reagan regime aided and abetted. The saving grace is that despite years of injustice ...some of the worst offenders are being brought to justice in Guatemala, at least. The odd relationships between the US evangelical hierarchy and the extreme right wingers of the GOP has never been brought to light by US msm ... despite US training and weapons, along with Israeli military trainers who worked in Central America during this period along also doing arms sales. Granito brings many of these threads together and weaves the story that once again reminds us that the moral arc of the universe is long...This is a must see if you are at all interested in justice, human rights and the prosecution of war criminals.
