Wonderful movie. Loved the Western scenery and the story of second chances and redemption. Marvelous casting was a treat against a sound track of genuine music. We thoroughly enjoyed Soda Springs. Not a lot of movies command a second or third watching, but this one does. The modern Western still conveys the timeless virtues of hard work and personal sacrifice for others. It feels human and real. Soda Springs unwinds a story without giving it all away upfront. It's the rare movie that successfully manages that unpredictability that makes you reconsider all that went before in a new light. Soda Springs lets the story unfold so that you care about the destination.The cinematography and directing are first rate without being self- conscious or obtrusive.Actors are uniformly excellent and included a couple of personal favorites, Tom Skerritt and Victoria Pratt. Skerritt commands the screen with quiet dialog. Victoria is both approachable and gorgeous in her denim clad small town persona. Star and co-screenwriter Jay Pickett plays the protagonist in a quiet, determined and ultimately winning fashion. Smaller roles feature effective newcomers like Hollis Welsh and established veterans including the perfect Patty McCormack. The Western theme carries over in a soundtrack dosed with some great, fresh Alt Country with a touch of Western Swing. I knew none of the music going in but loved the music and its compliment to the mood and high, lonesome Idaho scenery. Steve Fulton, Mickey and the Motorcars, and Travis Ward &amp; Hillfolk Noir are among those featured.It's easy to see why this was an award winner in film festivals like Breckenridge, Sun Valley and Louisville. Soda Springs is engaging, personal and meaningful. It stuck with me far longer than many big dollar, big star productions. Soda Springs is highly recommended.
