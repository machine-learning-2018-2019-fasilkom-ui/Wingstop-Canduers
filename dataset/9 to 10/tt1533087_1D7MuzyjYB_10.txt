I originally ordered this movie just to see an old classmate (Jay Pickett) act - boy did I get a surprise! I also expected to be drawn into the familiar scenery of where we grew up, but instead was drawn into the storyline so far that I forgot to watch the scenery! The storyline of redemption is one that is done frequently, but those of us that grew up in small towns and on farms know that it works differently there. The story is well-told and well paced, with beautiful Idaho scenery in the background. It truly deserves and has earned all of the film awards that it has gotten - and many more! It is a wonderful family story, and I will be sure that my 12 yr old and 7 yr old watch it.
