Soda Springs is a movie I will want to watch many times. I'm always a Tom Skerrit fan, but I saw many more nuances in his role in this film than ever before. Jay Pickett was only vaguely familiar to me, but I will definitely be looking for him in more films. Initially I wanted to see the movie to enjoy glimpses of familiar Idaho scenes, but the sincerity and increasing depth of the drama captivated my imagination and leaves me wanting to watch this movie again and again.The theme I took from the movie was the work and patience required in rebuilding a life - work wasn't enough, patience alone wasn't enough - and everyone concerned had to contribute their own work and patience. How do you make work and patience and more work and patience exciting to an audience? It took a lot of skill and courage on the part of everyone who made this film! Through unexpected characters and careful pacing I sensed and then shared the frustration of the main character as he had to wrestle his life and reputation from the backbiters in his hometown.The casting was well done and the locations were wonderful. I had expected to be pulled out of the story as I recognized familiar places, but instead that just added to the connection I felt with the characters. I still want my husband to watch Soda Springs so he can tell me if that pick-up Pickett drives is the same make as one we see around New Plymouth. It all felt so real to me that I can still feel the dust of the baseball diamond, squint into the bright sunlight and smell the inside of the feed store.That feeling of connection is part of the reason Soda Springs lingers in my mind so long after watching it. It is also the reason I'm not at all surprised to hear of the awards this movie is attracting.
