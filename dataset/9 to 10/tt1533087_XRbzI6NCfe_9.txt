Soda Springs is an uplifting story about second chances and redemption. It is a well acted and beautifully shot film with a couple of good plot twists. Many of the characters in the film are easy to identify with which brings it home in several scenes. It starts slowly and builds nicely. This film won best feature film at the Louisville International Festival of film last fall and just won the audience award at the Sun Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago. That says a lot. The film isn't rated, but, I would guess it's probably PG for those wondering. This is a great little indie film worth seeing.
