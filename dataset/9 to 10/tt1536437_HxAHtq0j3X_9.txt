On the surface Rushlights seems like it is going to be another conman/grifter flick but it delivers so much more. It presents a really solid suspenseful storyline.The basics of the story are these: Billy and Sarah are con men for Los Angeles who go to a small Texas town to claim an inheritance that is not theirs. Of course the town is even more corrupt and twisted than even they are. Aidan Quinn and Beau Bridges are brothers and both are prominent members of the community. It's hard to tell if the brothers are after Billy and Sarah because the smell a rat or just because they are "outsiders" in their town.Overall, Rushlights is a solid suspense drama with a lot of twists and turns. Haley Webb does a great job as Sarah and Bridges is terrific. My favorite performance is delivered by Aidan Quinn. I have been a fan of his for years. I've always liked him in Elementary and he does not disappoint in Rushlights.If you get a chance to catch this film I highly recommend you watch it.
