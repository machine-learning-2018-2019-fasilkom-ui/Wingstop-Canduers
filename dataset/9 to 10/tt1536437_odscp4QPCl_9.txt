I absolutely love this movie. I enjoyed and was pleasantly surprised of the twists and turns. There are quite a few surprises with unexpected many highs and lows which keep on the edge of your seats. Just when you thought you knew who the bad guys are ... you are indubitably brought into another realm of reality which further tests your abilities of predictable accuracy in anticipating the next set of outcomes. The movie moves at a nice pace. Beau Bridges and Aidan Quinn also brought some unexpected results in the direction where this movie was headed at times. Again, who is the good guy and who is the bad guys. The 2 main lead stars are a bit unknown and they gave a good rendition of seasoned veteran stars. Hope this review helps those who choose to watch this movie. Thanks Dan
