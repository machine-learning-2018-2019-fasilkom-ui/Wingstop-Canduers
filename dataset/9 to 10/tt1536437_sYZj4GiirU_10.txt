We found this movie entertaining from beginning to end with many sitting-on-the-edge-of-your-seat moments. Everyone in the cast is excellent. The young couple are believable - and likable. No matter what deceit the young couple were involved in, we felt sorry for them in their desperate situation and were rooting for them. This film has many twists in the plot which will keep you interested. Many films we rent have lengthy scenes that we feel need editing - however, this movie has excellent editing and is anything but boring! We highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a suspenseful story that keeps you guessing 'til the very end.
