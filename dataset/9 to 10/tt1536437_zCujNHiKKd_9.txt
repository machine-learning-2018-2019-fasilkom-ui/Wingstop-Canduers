I was very surprised after watching this movie. I really was not expecting it to be as good as it was, being that it did not make it to the big screens. Even if the critics were to tear it to pieces, much worse films make it to the big screens every week. I can definitely recommended it as a very enjoyable "Guy flick". It's got a good fair share of action for a thriller. It may not be a "Chick flick" but it has a sufficient amount of romance to make a good date movie. Over all the acting was great. The Plot has it's twist and turns to keep you from getting bored from predictability, which is the norm for most thrillers. If I was to find one thing to pick at. Maybe they could have cut the segment and story relating to the whipping scene. Was not very believable as the type of reaction you would expect from the main character. Maybe they wanted to show some extra skin. However it's a sure entertaining movie.
