Join the antics of three friends who start a year long journey originally in honor of Rachel Carson, and end up with a new child, a lot of stories, and many practical illustrations of people empowered to take action! This film just makes everyone want to try the game- all my garbage for a whole year in one box? Really? You should see the effect this has on people from so many dimensions. The humorous approach and the very personal story links us to the effort and draws us in. The characters the YERT-ians encounter along the way are so interesting and also inspiring. You come away from this film feeling ready to do just whatever you can, and knowing several places to start right away with your own journey. Everyone should see this film!
