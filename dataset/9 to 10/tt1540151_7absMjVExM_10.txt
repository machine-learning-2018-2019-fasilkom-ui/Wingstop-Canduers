I can't speak highly enough of not only the YERT film, but their entire production. They walk the talk. They spent the many years they produced this film, living the smaller footprint lives they lived while filming their journey. I've known them for over 4.5 years since I met them at the Green Festival (i'm briefly in that segment of this film! :) I was in the process at the time I met them of embarking on my own very similar environmental road trip film (by bicycle) to visit 100 sustainable communities (www.withinreachmovie.com). I have forever been inspired by their effort to hold on to the trash they produce. In fact I have lived with a bunch of our trash since my partner decided to do the same thing to build a house with someday! :) All in all their use of humor instead of fear has been so refreshing and the most effective tool to keep me (and hopefully others) not only interested in saving the planet, but inspired. See this film for it's great flow, diverse range of topics that cover the entire range of environmental solutions, and for it's pure entertainment. ~ Ryan Mlynarczyk, Director "Within Reach" movie, Co-Owner Reach Within Productions (www.reachwithinproductions.com)
