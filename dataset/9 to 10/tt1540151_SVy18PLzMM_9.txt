Freshest, most original media treatment of any topic I've seen in many a year. Loved the idea, the framework, the pacing, the brains, the humor, and most of all, the good will. It's "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" meets "Save the Planet." Ben, Julie and Mark have managed to bust through the rhetoric to create something magical in the form of YERT. They say what needs to be said and then move on to the next leg of the adventure. How much we could all learn from this simple technique. But something simple, and also high-quality, is rare indeed. May God bless these young idealists in all their camera-slinging travels. Can't wait to see what's next.
