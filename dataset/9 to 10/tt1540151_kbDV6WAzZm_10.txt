I am fortunate enough to own a copy of this film and to know the film makers! All I can say is the adventure experienced, the people involved, and the content covered are great. This film will make you laugh, cry, and everything in between. It highlights many great people and great ideas current to our society. Some of the ideas seem so simple you ask yourself "Why haven't we or why aren't we doing this now?" There are some very eye opening interviews and some of the content is not easy to stomach, but it gives one hope that people do care and that they can make a difference. It is definitely worth a watch. Enjoy with friends and family, or with complete strangers! I give it a THUMBS UP!
