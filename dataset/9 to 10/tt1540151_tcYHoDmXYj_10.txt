I absolutely love this film. I am a high school science teacher and I use this film to teach human impact for my ecology unit. It is wonderful because it shows the reality of things happening all around us while being positive. I feel it is unique to this topic because so many films give the doom and gloom feel. For young people, we need to educate and INSPIRE!! I have had 15 year old students cry, get angry, and get excited all from watching this film! Buy it, share it and educate with it- it is truly powerful!!! Wish I could go on a YERT 2 and would love a follow up on some of the amazing people met throughout the film!! Don't waste another minute......you have to watch this film!!
