I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I thought this was going to be another chick flick with a guy flirting with a girl but I found it was an amazing love story that spans 2 decades and gives a glimpse of what true love could really be. Anne H. was great for this because she is a timeless beauty that played her role through the years wonderfully, and Jim S. did a great job evolving with his character through immaturity to understanding. The European setting was beautiful and added to the scenes from the city to country side building the romance of it all.I wish I would have seen it sooner :)
