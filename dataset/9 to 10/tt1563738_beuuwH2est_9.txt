Greetings from Lithuania.I don't watch romantic movies often, but when i heard about story of "One day" i thought of giving it a chance. And it sure didn't disappoint me. This is a really good love story, told in a single day in a year in period of 23 years. Movie is beautifully filmed, with great acting by the two leads, especially from Anne Hathaway. She's just so ... beautiful in every meaning of this word. Can't wait to see her next summer in "TDKR". "One day" isn't your typical Hollywood love story and you can clearly FEEL that watching it. Give this movie a chance and you can be really surprised that when this movie will end, you'll fell your self a little ... brighter.
