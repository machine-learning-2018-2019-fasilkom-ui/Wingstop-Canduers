One Day is a mixture of romance/drama in the right measure, which shows a couple of friends who had their lives marked by day July 15. All the drama takes place in just one day of the year, and every year their life and their personality changes, leaving them increasingly distant. And each year that these differences make the inevitable distance, their love becomes more evident. Beautiful, charming, touching and romantic, with an end a little obvious, but still beautiful. Excellent performances, photography, script and soundtrack. Anne and Jim made a great couple. I recommend for anyone who loves a well told drama.
