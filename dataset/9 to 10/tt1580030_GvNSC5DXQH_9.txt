This film is a riot! Yes, it is no Hollywood production - but it is B- movie gold. Young kids will love this film, but be warned, some adults may be put off by the silliness. This is one of those rare films where the kids are the stars of the film and often the better actors. My young niece absolutely loved it just for that reason, plus, she likes anything about turtles!
