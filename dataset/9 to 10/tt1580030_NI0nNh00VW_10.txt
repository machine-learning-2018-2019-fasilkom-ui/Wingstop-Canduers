This was a beautifully done film for kids! No cursing, dirty jokes or underlying immoral message. This is a great clean movie for kids of all ages! It also has some educational facts in it! A film made by kids, for kids! It is not only funny but it has a great moral message and can connect to the audience in an emotional level as well. The performances of the cast was superb, it is hard to believe that the it is the actors first time on screen. My 6 year old nephew loved it! Would recommend to any parent who is looking for a good family film to watch with their children! Great job to all those who contributed to this film! I hope to see more films by Frank Eberling in the near future!
