Since I am a gay man, an ordained minister, someone who has worked in nursing homes for many years and over 60 years old I think this is an important documentary that should be widely watched especially by those in social services and in the health care field. This movie tackles the problems gays, lesbians, and transgender people face as they age. These people face the problems of discrimination when they become elderly and need someone to care for them. When they become frail and helpless, many gays and lesbians go back into the closet for fear of how they and their loved ones will be treated. This movie is a call to action to educate people and protect those who need protection. It is tragic that people who had to struggle to live openly, face fear in their final years. They deserve better and this movie makes a strong statement to support them.
