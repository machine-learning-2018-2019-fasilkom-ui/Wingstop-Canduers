I didn't have high expectations of this film due solely to it's title. How wrong I was! This is a popcorn movie of the best sort. Ridiculously over the top but in a very entertaining way.The action doesn't stop from the get go and there's a narrative that runs through the whole movie that keeps you interested.The SFX are impressive too.Performances are good, particularly Rufus Sewell who plays a very good villain. "Rufus Sewell" that's got to be a made up name. It's too cool to be a real name.One of the better vampire films in recent years.
