This little film is an unexpected knock-out - absolutely first rate. Made in Philadelphia, set around Rittenhouse Square, the location shooting is beautiful and the City of Brotherly Love looked more European than American. The cast is uniformly superb - an outstanding ensemble with each character developed and interesting. The storyline was consistently plausible and fascinating making you wonder constantly just how things would turn out. The dramatic climax was almost Shakespearean in its complexity but also very, very funny. The cast, although mostly unknown is highlighted by one of the gals from the hit TV show, Hot in Cleveland, Wendi Malick.
