I want to start by saying I don't take movies too seriously. If you can get me to sit through one...congrats on the writing &amp; execution. I had been dying to see this because one of my friends; local Dallas artist, Paco Estrada, has a song on the soundtrack. It's the beautiful medley when Corey &amp; Pete hookup. I'll do anything support Paco. I think the story is cute, I like the actors &amp; would recommend it to anybody. I had empathy for the main character &amp; enjoyed the comedic relief of the sister. I also felt for the Pete. The first boyfriend, was a perfect antagonist. The clients are a little far fetched. I think it's to make you see how much worse things could be on the other side of the fence.
