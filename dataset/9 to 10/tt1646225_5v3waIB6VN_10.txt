Shouting Secrets has all of the ingredients that makes for a great movie . . . it makes you laugh, it makes you cry and, most of all, it has characters that everyone can identify with in their lives. The acting in this film is award-winning and the cinematography is beautiful. The film has won multiple awards in the many film festivals for which it has been selected, often times becoming the Audience Favorite award-winner. The story is one that shows a family facing struggles - many of which we have all gone through ourselves. The use of Native American people also gives a unique blend of old traditions with new. A must-see film.
