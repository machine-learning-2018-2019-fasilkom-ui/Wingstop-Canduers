This movie is fabulous, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry, and it makes you want to go home and call your family just to say hello and I love you!!! I have not enjoyed a family film this much in a long time. The acting was superb, the scenery was eye opening, and the reality of the situation hits home for so many families. I cant wait for it to come out on the big screen so my family can enjoy going and watching it in Colorado. My friend and I both felt that it was well written, well put together, and we enjoyed it immensely. Kudos to Korrina for an excellent job of directing it. Paula Mitchell
