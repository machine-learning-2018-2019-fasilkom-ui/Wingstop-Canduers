Last year I was an honoree and a teacher at the Big Island Film Festival. I am a story/career consultant for writers. I went to see a majority of the films while I was there. There was a major buzz going around the festival about "Shouting Secrets" even before it played. I went to see it. I've worked in the entertainment business for over 20 years. I can honestly say that I think this movie made me feel more than any movie that I've seen in years. I laughed and I cried. I connected with the story on every level. The audience laughed and cried. It was such a pleasurable experience to see a film of this caliber at a festival. I think we all knew that there was something special going on with this film. It is one that I will never forget. For me, I think that "Shouting Secrets" parallels with "The Descendents" on many levels conceptually. However, for me, it is a stronger film. I understood and rooted for the journey much more. I was connected to the outcome. I LOVE this movie!
