An amazing, well thought out story and film that delivered more than I hoped. Awesome production and cast was incredible. KUDOS! This needs to be on the big screens globally. The filming and the locations were perfect for the setting/s of this film. The cast was in character and played each part that seemed made for them. Shouting secrets draws you in and keeps you there. This producer did not overlook any detail and delivered an amazing experience. The cast chosen represented the foundation of this film and brought the story to life scene by scene. The story line from start to finish was solid and kept me engaged and wanting to see what was going to unfold next
