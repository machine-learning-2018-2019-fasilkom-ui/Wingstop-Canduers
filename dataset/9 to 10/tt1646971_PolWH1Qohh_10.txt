As a huge fan of the first movie I didn't believe the second could be better, I've never been so happy to be wrong! This movie was breathtaking, heart-wrenching, astounding, beautiful, and funny! Without doubt the best movie I have ever seen. I convinced my mother to come see it with me, she was skeptical but humored me and she was just as blown away as I was. We had to go back to the theater to see it again. One of my favorite things about the first one was the music and I was thrilled that John Powell managed to top the original score. Like the movie itself, the music is more mature and absolutely sweeps you away. I listen to the soundtrack every day and I still marvel at its power and the emotion it evokes. Don't be put off because it's(beautifully)animated, you won't find a better movie! Now we just have to endure the long wait till the final movie. How can they top this? I don't know, but I have faith that they will!
