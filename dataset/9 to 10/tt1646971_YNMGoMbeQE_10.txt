This sequel sucks, this sequel is inferior, this sequel is inferior.  Yes, I once felt the same. BUT! It all changes after a ... R E W A T C  H ...  The reason? in the first watch .. you can't help but compare to the  first one.  The facing is too darn fast.  So much thing is going on. It is very busy.  In my first watch .. I too was disappointed to the movie. But, I give  it another try and rewatch. Now that I know what will happen, Now that  I know everything. I was able to keep up with the pacing and appreciate  the beauty of this sequel. After I a rewatch, I finally see why people  says this movie is an improvement.  So, if your disappointed .. REWATCH IT !! I guarantee you, it will help  a lot. and if your wondering Why am I doing this? because HTTYD  community is freaking small. I don't want fellow fans to lose their  hope in this series.  It's not Frozen, It's not Disney, It's not Pixar. When Disney and Pixar  release movies, everybody is excited. When dreamworks release movie ..  WHO THE HELL CARES? .. I don't want HTTYD community to decrease. Who  will support this series if the fans a gone? HTTYD is an amazing series  and lets support it.
