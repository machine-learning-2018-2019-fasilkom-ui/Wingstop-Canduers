I have a chance to see this in a early screening today. I can guarantee you, the wait is worth-it. For me it is as good as the first one (and if you prefer epic action, this one is definitely better), but my favorite is still the first one because it completely took me by surprise.Animation? Superior !! but the proper credit to say is cinematography. 3D effects is easy to achieve today because of advancements in technology. But it takes great cinematography to capture your imagination. If you are tired of "lazy" 3D, then watch this one.Story? The Best! I won't tell anything about the plot. But I will say that the story connected to me so well. It is about "Coming out of Age"***************WE ENCOUNTER A TIME IN OUR LIFE WHEN WE ASK, "WHAT DO I WANT TO DO?" "WHERE DO I WANT TO BE?" .. we usually ask those questions during graduations.**************This movie will definitely help you find the "inner you". I wish this movie is shown during the time I graduated. My transition from college to real world would have been a thousand times easier.DON'T LISTEN TO STUPID TROLLS, or YOU'LL MISS A WONDERFUL MOVIE EXPERIENCE.
