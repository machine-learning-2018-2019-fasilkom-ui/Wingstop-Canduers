Since the Vietnam War, when friends were conscripted and I missed out, I wanted to join up for my country.... Glad I didn't, I may not be alive today even if I did come home! I read way back, years ago about the number who committed suicide after they came home and just couldn't adjust, almost as many died at home as did in combat!
Disgusting way to abandon Vets after any conflict they wee involved in!
If this movie doesn't stir some emotions, then the viewer must have a heart of stone!......
