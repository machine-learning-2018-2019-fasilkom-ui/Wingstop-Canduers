As a veteran, I saw healing processes in this movie. Some parts were difficult to watch while others were very warming and fulfilling. I saw a loving husband and father that suffered from poor choices made by not only himself but other key people in his life. I saw a man who was healing himself by helping others. I saw a man, who even though down and out, refused to give up and pulled those around him, up on their feet to stand tall and be proud of who they are.
