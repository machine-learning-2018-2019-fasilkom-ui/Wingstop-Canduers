If you were an avid fan of the TV show you will LOVE this movie and be waiting for the next one. Throw in our favorite 4 is back, Ari Gold being well ARI GOLD, an interesting but simple story line and a cameo of guest star appearances from basically everyone Mark Walberg knows or who he has acted with and it works so well!The reviews on this page are harsh it is almost like the people were never fans of the series yet expected the movie to be different?!Best example I can give, is someone going to watch the Family Guy movie or the Simpson movie, yet hates the series, and is disappointed to find they dislike the movie - SHOCKER!
