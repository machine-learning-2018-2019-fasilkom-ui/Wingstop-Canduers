You probably don't understand the movie or like it if you never watch the series, but if you watched the series you probably love it, is great the last adventure of the gang, so you will enjoy a one last time of entourage in 140 minutes of memories and comedy. If you don't watch the series, you may probably see this movie and don't understand a thing, or maybe you probably don't find it funny, so my advice is very simple, if you watch the full series, you're gonna love it, if you don't you can probably say that this movie is bad, but personally i love it. The movie follow the story and doesn't miss a detail of it. PS: i love Johnny Drama.
