Absolutely loved this movie! Wonderful scenery of Alaska. Made me laugh, sometimes cry! Excellent! Well made. The music is catchy and the band, Erik the Red does an excellent job. I've watched it several times and can always find something new to enjoy in it. It has won several awards at film festivals, but sadly, is not available yet to the general public. The star, Jonathan Goold, believes there is gold under the receding glaciers of Alaska. Beautiful shots of glaciers calving, and Goold rock climbing. Gives you an accurate idea of life in small town, Valdez, Alaska, Goold's hometown. Wish this movie was available to the public.Find it and watch it!
