Where to start. I was blown away by this film from start to finish. Its not an action epic and its not a jump a minute thriller. Its a solid story about horrible people doing horrible things and ensuring that those around them think they are wonderful.The film was hard to watch and actually left me feeling fairly unpleasant when the credits roll, I can only assume this was director Amy Bergs intention. I have not read the book so I cant speak to how closely it follows the source material and I don't think it hindered my viewing of this film in the least.the film weaves seamlessly between past and present never causing confusion or convoluting what's going on. If your a fan of great story telling, super believable acting and drama to spare this is for you.I am well aware that I've not actually described anything in the film as the synopsis at the top of the page does that, instead I've decided to describe the quality of the film in both story and direction. A solid 9 for me.
