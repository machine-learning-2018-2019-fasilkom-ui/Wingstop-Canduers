This movie is a fantastic thriller! There are unexpected twists and turns that make your mind go crazy. It is not your typical bloody, gory, slice-em-up movie. The movie has a limited number of main characters which really helps the audience feel like a part of the show. You'll feel the fear along with the characters. The closeness inside the vehicle was so enhanced by the angles and closeness of the cameras to the actors.Four of the main characters in the movie are teens. The movie was written to reflect today's teen...the cell phones, the texting, the vocabulary and language used between them. Pleasantly, there was not use of the vulgarity of the f-bomb! All of these details made me feel like they were kids who lived right down the street."Munger Road" will force your mind to draw conclusions, wonder what's going to happen next, and even make you want to yell at the characters: "Don't!" Even better, this movie has been a focus of much discussion and disagreement among movie-goers a month after the first screening. It is truly a mind-jogging thriller worth seeing over and over again!
