Munger Road is a great Thriller and Suspense Movie,I enjoyed the Cast especially Bruce Davidson. The Story line is very cool and the movie moves at a great pace. The story is very believable and first time director Smith does a fantastic job. Nice to see a movie that is not all blood and guts and actually has the audience thinking. Reminds me of the Alfred Hitchcock film genre. The film ends with the lead in to a Munger Road 2 , I see this story line having the capability of carrying at least two sequels. This would make a great TV Series for cable I can'not wait to see the sequel as this has been one of the best suspense films that I have seen since " Signs"
