My 19 year old brought it home to watch with friends. I joined and was shocked at how funny it was. The movie isn't kid friendly but hit home for me, my teen and her friends. I've told all my co-workers to get it at blockbuster asap. A couple have and now we quote it around the work place. If you like office space, clerks or just hate pop culture you'll love this. As an older woman I was able to watch it and enjoy the film making fun of the younger people. The pink shirts and gender bending pants. It's refreshing to see this and think all hope is not lost for my daughters generation. My husband loved the parts making fun of MMA fighting and the father figure's lecture to his son. Overall our entire family was shocked at how good this was. It is clearly not a big budget film but it's still good. We look forward to whatever this guy makes next. 10 out of 10 for us.
