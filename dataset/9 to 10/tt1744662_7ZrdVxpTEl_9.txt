Simple, concise, and beautiful, one of the strengths of Scheib's The Mayor is that it does not need some sort of over-arcing narrator attempting to explain the significance of the film. Rather, there is such strength in the emotional resonance of each of the people whom Scheib follows in this Dallas retirement home that the viewer remains captivated from the first minute of the film to the last. Scheib moves beyond the typical archetypes of love between our nation's senior citizens, revealing that love, companionship, and commitment can be as complex and intricate among those nearing 90 as it can be for someone just beginning adolescence. These people are not reduced to characters. They remain real throughout, experiencing real happiness, real humor, and real loss, and it is this honesty that the viewer must most appreciate.
