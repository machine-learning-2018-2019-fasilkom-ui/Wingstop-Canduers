I loved this documentary. And to be honest, I didn't know what to expect going into it, and not necessarily having an interest in the elderly, I debated with myself about whether or not to go. Fortunately, I did choose to go and I was blown away by how transfixing the story was. Not only was it did it have a great story line that followed a character that was delightful on screen(Sam), but it was also full of humor and heartfelt moments. The reality of death and those left behind was documented with care and respect. I was constantly amazed by the vulnerability of the characters with the intimate stories that they shared. You could see that such a trust was built during the creation of the film between the film-maker and the characters. I think the true value of this film comes from the vulnerability of the characters and their comfortability to share with the film maker what they are really feeling and thinking. This film not only makes me respect older people more, but also get kind of excited to become one one day.
