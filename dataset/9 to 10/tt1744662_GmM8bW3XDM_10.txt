What a humanizing, funny and sad portrait of life. This documentary shows the octogenarian cast as people, rather than stereotypes or tropes, and it made me realize that's so often how I see the elderly. The movie doesn't assuage any fears you may as a viewer have about getting old and death. But it does portray the people in our midst who think about it more often than many of us, and how they behave in their day-to-day lives. The cast is so different from the non-elderly in some obvious ways, but it also shows similarities and flaws we all share, and it's done in a way that's respectful and true. It's a great movie, and I look forward to more from this director.
