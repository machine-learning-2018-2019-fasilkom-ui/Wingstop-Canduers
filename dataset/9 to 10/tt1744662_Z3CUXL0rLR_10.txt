Just finished watching for the second time! Captivating, heartwarming, funny and real. The emotions are raw and I feel a connection with the characters, so much so that I want to keep in touch.Watching a piece like this is a great reminder of how important it is to love and understand those who came before us. Their experiences, their knowledge is unceasingly valuable. Scheib does a terrific job of sharing their stories in a way that makes them relevant, interesting and worthwhile.What this documentary does best, however, is demonstrate that people are people, no matter what age. They feel, they hurt, they want, they fight, they laugh, they cry. Easy to forget but important to remember.A fantastic film and I'm looking forward to more.
