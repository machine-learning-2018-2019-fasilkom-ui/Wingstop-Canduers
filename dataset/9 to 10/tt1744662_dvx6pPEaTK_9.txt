I'm not sure what I was anticipating from The Mayor. I guess I was expecting to laugh at some old folks saying some silly things and then go home, entertained. I did laugh, in actuality, very much, but there's so much more to it than that. The Mayor is deeply moving and thought provoking. It makes you consider what's important in life, what it will be like to take care of an aging loved one, and what it will be like to become elderly yourself. When it's funny, it is side-splitting. When it's touching, it does more than bring tears to your eyes. This film moves something deep within and makes for great conversation. Highly recommended!
