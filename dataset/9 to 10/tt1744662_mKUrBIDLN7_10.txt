Before seeing this film, I had quite a dismal outlook on life in old age. Basically, I dreaded getting old, boring, senile, and irrelevant. That isn't to say that I ever really gave the matter much thought...until this film.As other readers have expressed, I was rather hesitant to commit myself to 1.5 hours watching a documentary about old people, but I must say that I am glad I did. Much respect to the director for tackling this topic with such flare. Not only did he wiggle his camera into a myriad of retirement home romances, but he presented them in such a way that allows even a 16 year old to relate to them as peers, which is what impressed me most.All-in-all, an amazingly unique/relevant topic, presented with all the intrigue, emotion, and storyline of a studio film. And then some.
