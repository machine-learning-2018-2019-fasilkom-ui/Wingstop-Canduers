A very insightful documentary covering the many facets of aging. I laughed out loud several times and was equally touched and saddened at times. Very honest and unafraid. Sam as a character is complex and how he moves forward and is kind and compassionate in the face of serious struggle is nothing short of inspirational. Several of the characters in the film seem too good to be true, but the fact that they are makes is all the more endearing. I really appreciate the breadth of the topics covered, hitting on various fascets of the human experience as death is faced in such different ways. I highly recommend this documentary for the perspective it gives on life, regardless of your current age.
