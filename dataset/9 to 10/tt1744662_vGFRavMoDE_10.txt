Just had a chance to catch this documentary at the Lone Star International Film Festival and was completely blown away! Whereas many documentaries might exploit real people in order to create an intriguing story, this film lets the characters' authenticity drive the story to hilarious, eye-opening, and heart-breaking conclusions. The Mayor's title character, Sam Berger, proves that living in a nursing home can be everything but boring, and that living your life to the fullest will keep you young. The whole cast of characters that live in this nursing home are engaging and entertaining.I never thought that a nursing home could be so interesting of a subject, and this documentary demonstrates otherwise. Easily one of the best docs I have seen in recent years, and I believe it will go on to bigger and better things. Highly recommended. 10/10
