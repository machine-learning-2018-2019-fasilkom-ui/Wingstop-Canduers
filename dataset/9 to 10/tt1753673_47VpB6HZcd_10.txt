Let me start by saying that this is a comedy, so you must understand that from the first minute.Me and my girlfriend spent the entire movie laughing, it is really really funny.A simple story, but telled with so much humor and good taste, its also a family safe movie, (well kinda, there's some male nudity), but really its funny.I don't get how this movie can be so low on IMDb while some other crap starring American actors gets over 6.It kinda reminded me of the War of the Roses, lol another family war movie, but this one is much more funny.The cast is marvelous, the scenes are so funny, and well i was sad when it was over lol. Me want more !! Highly recommended.
