No wonder no one has reviewed this yet; Neither am I. Almost sorry I watched it.Last few months I've been watching History Chanell; mostly WW2 Documentaries. Familiar with: Battles, Weapons used, Generals on Both sides, etc. etc. Also I've known about this Event since I was very young.But this- film, excellently photographed, and Dramatized, showed details that are mostly absent in Documentaries.Anyone 'can Google' Lidice and come up with a TON of stories, videos, etc. But this Dramatazation of the Event, and what came Before it, was too personal for me.I feel Sick.If you are interested in History, you may want to watch it.Grateful it was NOT as Graphic as some Holocost Accounts; stopped watching Movies about: Holocost, Native American Genocide, Viet Nam War, American Slavery, etc.Now I'm going to get numb.
