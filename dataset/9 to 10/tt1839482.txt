I thought it was a great movie, considering those who watch it will not know what scenes were cut out completely. The Sarasota, FL bar scene and all in it, cut out...Aay Mate...The Sarasota school scene, where are the girls? Cut out.. That is a disappointment for all that participated and waited 2 years to see. The movie needed to last 1/2 hr. longer. But all in all, it was a great production True Story. I like the mix you put in it. It was a pleasure and FL Boy enjoyed participation. Cast was wonderful. Wish I could have kept some photos........but rules are rules, right Mr. Moyer....Good job Annie and everyone else.FL MOM
