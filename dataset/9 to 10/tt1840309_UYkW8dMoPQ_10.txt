This movie was astounding. Even though it may not be exactly like the book, the characters, acting, storyline, etc, WERE ON POINT! The actors did a great job as especially the main characters Four (Theo James) and Tris (Shaliene Woodley) did so good at expressing the actual romance from the book that people actually wanted them to be together in real life. This movie also has a lot of action, and also was suspenseful as sometimes I wouldn't expect people attacking Tris at one point and etc, etc. I don't know why so many people are hating on this movie when it was so compacted with all the emotions from betrayal, to sadness, to anger, to happiness, to romance. But you know haters gonna hate.This movie is just hands down very well put together.
