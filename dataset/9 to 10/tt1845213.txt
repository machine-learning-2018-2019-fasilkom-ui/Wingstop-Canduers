Amazing documentary a must see for those who are interested of the fruition of some of the volunteer work in Africa. I saw this at the SXSW film festival and coming out of the theater I was so sure that this film would win one of the the festival awards for documentary that I began inviting friends to the awards screening at the end of the festival even before the voting had ended. Sure enough it picked up the audience award for best documentary. Great work by Turk Pipen, great cause and just a satisfying movie to watch and to understand the hard work behind the mission of bringing education to other parts of the world. I applaud the efforts for the cause and this movie.
