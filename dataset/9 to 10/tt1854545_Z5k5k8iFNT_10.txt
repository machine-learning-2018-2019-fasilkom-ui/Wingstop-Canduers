The movie was excellent! Chris is following his dream, and as you watch you'll see how friends, family, and people he meets on this journey are cheering for him. He's a talented guy, friendly, faithful and family oriented. His music is meaningful. Things get tough, but it seems to make him more determined. You'll laugh along with the funny times, and feel his struggles as they relate to the struggles we all face. You're in for some unexpected things, but unexpected and Chris seem to go together. It's a movie that you don't want to miss a minute of, because you just don't know what will happen next. I can honestly say that I think most people would enjoy it ... so go make yourself happy and enjoy the movie!
