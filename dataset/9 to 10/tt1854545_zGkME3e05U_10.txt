If you are looking for a great feel-good movie without the typical corny kid stuff or unrealistic fairy tales, then this may just be the movie for you. The main character, driven by the almost child-like faith that he can achieve his goal to not only get his music heard by the idols of his youth, but make a feature film about his pursuit. This movie has you believing in the long forgotten American Dream again, Jersey Style. Chris Vaughn takes the audience along for the ride while he pursues his dream, encountering many characters unique to the Jersey Shore experience. I should add that I watched it twice with my family and liked it more the second time. My first viewing I rated it a 7 out of ten, but after the second viewing I must give it an 8. I added two bonus stars for an even ten, for each time I watch the film.
