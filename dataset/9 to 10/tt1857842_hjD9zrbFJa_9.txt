When I was invited to the preview of Redd Inc, I like others was not sure what to expect. Having seen Angst a few years ago on TV I at least knew I'd be getting a witty film, and I wasn't wrong. I'm a fairly picky horror fan, but I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It almost feels like a comic book in a lot of places, due to the colourful way it is shot and executed. It was unexpectedly funny, had characters I related to and I found myself rooting for their survival. The female lead is spunky and has character, she's not a cardboard cut-out. I enjoyed Redd Inc from start to finish, I felt it broke free of many of the flaws and traps that horror films seem to fall into. To go into more detail would be giving too much away. I highly recommend that horror fans see this one for themselves. It's not big Hollywood, it's definitely got that indie feel about it but there's fun to be had here.
