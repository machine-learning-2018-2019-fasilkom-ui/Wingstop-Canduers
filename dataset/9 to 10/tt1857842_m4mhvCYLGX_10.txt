It feels saw-Esq at the start, but that changes. I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the acting was good. The camera work was fine. The plot moved along nicely, I never got bored. If you don't mind blood and gore, you will hopefully love this movie as much as I did. I would recommend this movie to anyone age 18 and over. It is certainly no worse than a Jason or Freddy movie. I really loved the very end. I really liked the main girl, the actress did a great job. I hope she does more movies in the future. Thanks for reading! If you liked this, please uprate. I gave it 10/10, just because movies like this tend to disappear, and I really liked this one.
