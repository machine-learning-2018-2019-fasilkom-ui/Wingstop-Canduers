Without much stash around it, it tells a love story anybody can relate to or believe in. That they are lesbians, to me a plus, has nothing to do with the story - it's a love story. It helps that it's Swedish - such a great language - and so far from Hollywood.A lot of great lesbian love stories has been made around the world in the last 20 years: Intimates (China), Fire (India), Produceing Adults (Finland), Between Two Women (GB), Aimée &amp; Jaguar (Germany), I Can't Think Straight (Middleeastern, but UK) and (of course) Imagine You and me (UK) - not to mention all the rest from eastern Europe, Malaisia, Japan and South America - and all the other countries who are breaking the boundaries. Cudos to you all. But "Kyss Mig" kind of beats them all of the above for me because of it's honesty. All hypocrisy was set aside - it was what it was and people got hurt. I like that. To me that's life. Get a few blows - give a few blows. We are what we are - we do what we do.The two leads, Ruth Vega Fernandez as Mia and Liv Mjönes as Frida, gives beautiful performances, as do Lena Endre as the mom and Krister Henriksson as the rather confused and in denial father of Mia. And I loved Mia's brother, Oscar, played by Tom Ljungman. Actually - the only one I did not get a feel of was Tim, the boyfriend of Mia, played by Joakim Nätterqvist. Maybe a script thing but he came over too one dimensional to me. As for cudos: Great one to you, Alexandra-Therese Keining, writing it and for directing it !!! AND to you Josefine Tengblad, producer, playing Elin, Fridas girlfriend. Great job!!And for "rumpanbar" (meening in Swedish "bare ass") who gave it a 1 !! Are you for real ???All in all: I love this film !
