I loved this film. It is beautiful and brave, with great Swedish actresses (and actors). I suppose the story is quite "cliché" but that's nothing you think of while watching it, at all. The film is very emotionally intense. And again, the performance from the actresses, Ruth Vega Fernandez and Liv Mjönes is amazing.There's also a lot of parts that you can relate to (straight or gay) and that's very positive. As it is touching in many ways you do also get a few good laughs on the way! :)(Can also add that I adore where the setting take place. Especially because I've been to them places myself. One scene is shot at my school which of course makes it funnier to watch) Anyhow, I strongly recommend you to watch it, it won't leave you unaffected..
