I'm more than surprised to see that the non-flattering comments are mostly made by Swedish viewers...? Anyway,I usually don't write reviews about movies I watch or about books that I read, but KYSS MIG is a movie that certainly drives your attention. I've watched the film 3 times and today I also bought the DVD. It's not all about lesbian love (which by itself is a catchy theme),it is mostly about choosing to follow unconventional paths in your life &amp; have the guts to stand up for your choices &amp; respect them. We have seen many films arguing with such issues, and KYSS MIG is one of the most well told: facts which the two partners have to face and how realistically are attributed through the dialogues. The story unravels so smoothly, the filming is captivating, the landscapes are romantic by their own, the hole atmosphere is so authentic. The flirting scenes (for which I wanted more)is the best part about this movie: you can almost catch the sexual tension between the two leads, it is so well done by reaching its climax with the love-making scenes, which are so believable. I cant see where the comments about morality fit in order to characterize it a good or a bad movie, although some users do. In real life you cheat &amp; you get cheated, you dump &amp; you get dumped, there is no guarantee for eternal love &amp; devotion. Closing, I strongly believe that this is a must see film, especially by those who can appreciate the real life romanticism.
