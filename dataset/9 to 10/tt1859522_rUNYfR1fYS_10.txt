YES, undoubtedly this is the one of the best romantic, emotional, touchy movie I have ever seen in my life.Amazing performance by Mia and Frida, magnificent landscape of Sweden and fluency and realness in every scene made me impatient, excited and happy throughout the film.The film is not just about a love story between two woman, it is also struggle for today's people who believe in true love.On the one side Mia (Ruth Vega Fernandez) is a bit shy with Frida as normally at the beginning in their relationship.But after seeing honesty, warmth, sincerity in Frida's eyes, she began to look differently and gave her love for the Frida especially with her spectacular eyes.On the other side Frida( Liv Mjönes) draws a character who is not afraid of being seen by everyone for her love for woman and she was also insistent about the possibility of a real love between tho woman.Moreover she also abandoned from her girlfriend and expected it from Mia in the same way.For this reason we see many Fridas in our today's world. To sum up, love is everywhere and can be in every way and no one prevent it in real life.
