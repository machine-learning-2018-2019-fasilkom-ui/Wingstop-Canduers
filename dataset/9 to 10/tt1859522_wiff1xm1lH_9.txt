I don't see how anyone could rate this movie poorly. It had a great plot and great actors. Too many times have I seen movies like this and they always turn out bad so it was great to see one that didn't follow the majority. Personally I found the actress that played Mia amazingly talented. She is able to show every emotion just through her big beautiful eyes. Throughout the movie her face would be devoid of any expression but her eyes showed everything. It was great. The only reason I gave a 9 out of 10 is because I speak English so I had to read subtitles and that takes away a bit from the greatness of the movie. I recommend it highly and you won't be disappointed.Cons: English subtitles Pros: Ruth Vega Fernandez (Mia) was exceptional. The playfulness between Mia and Frida. Basically everything was great about the movie. Even the cute kid brother Oskar and the fiancé.
