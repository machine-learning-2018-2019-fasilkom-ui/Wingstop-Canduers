Love is love and every one have the right to love. It's a breathe taking movie about following ones heart and not necessarily following the "norm" or what is expected from us. The trailer doesn't do justice to how beautifully it was shot and how fantastic the acting was. Liv Mjönes and Ruth Vega Fernandez gives a prime example of brilliant acting. It was subtle, sweet, natural and believable. The story is solid and identifiable. The movie is gaining ground and will probably be distributed/shown in USA soon. I suggest seeing it/buying it. Absolutely great film. Overall, this is beautiful story with great acting.
