This movie is about Art!It uses the Art as a mean to illustrate the Art as an end.The Art is used in literal sense. Namely, the exterior is set in Rome (and a bit of Prague) which are finest art statements to this day, while the interior scenes are shot in gorgeous villas among pieces of art (voluptuous sculptures, sensuous paintings, precious pieces of furniture).But more importantly, The Art is used in metaphorical sense: The Art of transforming one's Passion into Possession. The Art of transforming one's drive for Perfection and striving for owns Protection into one's Flow and Vulnerability. The Art of merging opposing feelings, causing inner conflicts, arousing thousand emotions, attacking all senses, shaking the nerves...shaking the very ground until......until it becomes the ultimate Work of Art itself!Bravo Maestro's: Tornatore, Moriconne and Rush!Biljana Gjoneska - www.evermind.me
