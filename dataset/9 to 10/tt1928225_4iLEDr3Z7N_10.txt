Destinos Interrumpidos (Interrupted Destiny) is an amazing documentary film that would keep you glued to your seat till the end. I first saw this film at a film festival, where the powerful narrative of the film made the audience go "wow". Although there have been movies or TV shows about being switched at birth, they compare nothing to Destinos Interrupidos. The story unfolds in the beautiful, coastal town of Cartagena, Colombia where two kids are accidentally switched at birth by the hospital staff. The boy born to a well to do family is passed onto a family not so fortunate in life's luxuries. And the boy from the ordinary family is given to the rich family. Although, the families live only about 20 minutes apart, the two boys grow up without knowing the trick destiny played on them: until age 26 when they meet face to face for the first time. This documentary is a roller coaster of emotions, surprises, tears and lost moments and memories. The filmmakers have done a marvelous job in telling the story of the two families with sensitivity and objectivity without losing the powerful narrative that underlies this film. The documentary features superb cinematography, capturing the beauty of Cartagena and subtle nuances of the environments in which the two young men grow up. Combined that with flawless editing and perfect music, you'll find yourself watching this movie more than once! I highly recommend this film to anyone.
