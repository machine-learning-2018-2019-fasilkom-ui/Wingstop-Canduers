Destinos Interrumpidos is a highly recommended documentary with an outstanding cinematographic level, and, being an excellent documentary, it highlights and makes this real life story very attractive through a very impressive narrative sensibility. This documentary exposes its plot through the voices of both families that were affected, and whose characters we feel we love, because through their tales they touch our hearts, while at the same time it takes us on a journey across the beautiful and magical city of Cartagena de Indias, in Colombia; these elements make up a structured narration that generates in us, the audience, feelings of drama,unexpected suspense and genuine emotion. About Destinos Interrumpidos,I can say that the whole time I watched it, it kept me very interested, glued to the screen,and emotionally committed to the story. Congratulations to the directors for an impeccable product worth watching!
