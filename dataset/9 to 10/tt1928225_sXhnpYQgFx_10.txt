This documentary was a complete surprise, I never imagined I could be so moved by a story. Even though the story itself is a powerful one, the director did a great job of telling it in a compelling, artistic and compassionate way. The story takes you on a journey to Cartagena, Colombia a place where I have never been but that after watching the documentary want to visit very much. I really enjoyed the visuals of Cartagena and was mesmerized by the story of what happened there. It's amazing to think that something like what happened in Cartagena, has actually happened in other places around the world. Not only did I really enjoyed the combination of a very compelling story combined with visually stimulating footage. This documentary really takes you for a ride, I was sucked in from the start and couldn't stop watching until the end. I highly recommend it!
