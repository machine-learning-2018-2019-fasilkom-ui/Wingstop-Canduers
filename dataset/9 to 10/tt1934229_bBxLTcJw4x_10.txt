When I got this movie, I had no expectations besides a typical low-budget slasher flick. I was surprised! It wasn't that at all! There is a horror element to the story, but more a psychological horror. The flow of the story got me interested, and as it went along, kept me there. Granted, the acting isn't Pacino or even Eastwood, but the low-budget, for lack of a better term, keeps the story feeling real, so to me, it works. There is some nudity in the movie, and as with many independent movies, it could have turned obligatory. But it isn't here. If fact, without giving away any story, when I saw the girls, I felt bad for them. They were successful in making those scenes sympathetic. I really liked the soundtrack. Great choice of composer and music. Again, it works. My favorite characters were the sheriff with his low-key approach, and Ranger Swanson's humorous delivery. I do recommend Dead Woman's Hollow to fans of psychological thrillers. I found it a good watch.
