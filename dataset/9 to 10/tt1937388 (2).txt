Superbly crafted, edge-of-your seat thriller. The plot flows seamlessly and there's never a dull moment as the action keeps coming. Without giving too much away... the movie has a great twist that you don't even see coming. Writers Inon and Natalie Shampanier have created a film that keeps your attention all the way through and Dominic Moynaghan and Jordan Belfi portray their roles very convincingly. The only downside of the film was the way it was cut up into chapters on Vuguru.com so you will need to watch each 4-5 minute clip separately but I found myself wanting to watch the next clip immediately after one had finished. Mr. Shampanier has done a splendid job on his first full feature and I will be looking for more of his work in the future.
