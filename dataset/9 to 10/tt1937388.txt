The first thing i thought about when starting this film was whether i could see Dominic Monaghan as anyone but, Merry from Lord of the Rings. Apparently i can and although i had my doubts about watching a low key film with actors i didn't really know or cared existed it was still brilliant. The plot unlike many other films in my opinion doesn't sag in the middle and you are put in constant suspense about the future of the main character (holy water seller) and the taxi driver. The acting is brilliant in this film and it is very clever in places in my opinion (although i am quite simple minded). Overall before seeing the film on the shelf or on sky movies (or any other TV thing) don't hesitate to watch it. It's pulled off brilliantly and it has quite a unique storyline. Basically watch it.
