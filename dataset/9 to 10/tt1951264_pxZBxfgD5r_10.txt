The entire year I've been waiting for this moment when The Hunger Games: Catching Fire would come out and I would go and see it. I had so many expectations going into the theater; was it going to be better than the first? Did they put everything that was in the book in the movie? Is it going to be worth it? Well I am pleased to say that the answer to all these questions are yes. This movie is by far one of the best franchise movies to date...Go suck it Twilight. Hunger Games Rule!! The acting was amazing, Jennifer Lawrence...I am in love, I don't know where she came from but she's from out of this world. They could not have casted a better Katniss, this girl it on fire! Josh Hutcherson might have grown up a bit and his portrayal of Peeta Mellark was outstanding. The rest was awesome, the victory tour, the parties, the tributes parade, the tributes, the arena, the obstacles in the arena, the CGI was memorable, and the emotion that these actors brought to the set was unforgettable.It's way better than the first one. And I'm so glad they did this one justice. I wish I could give this movie a fifteen out of ten, because it's just fantastic.If the second one was this good...then I cannot wait for Mockingjay Part 1 and Part 2. It's gonna be epic...
