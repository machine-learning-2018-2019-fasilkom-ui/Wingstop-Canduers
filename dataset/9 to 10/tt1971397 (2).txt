I pleasantly stumbled across this movie and am really thankful that I did. I can't help but admire the writer and filmmaker, Paul Osborne. He not only crafted an amazing story that was filmed very well on what appears to be on an ultra low budget, he cast the film so well, especially with the two main actors, who's performances were stellar. Other than a couple of scenes that could have been stronger, I find this film to be an A+ across the board. Great story, solid dialogue, wonderful editing and simple story telling with the cinematography, which was a great choice for this type of story. Mr. Osborne really let the actor's performances and his writing tell this story and the result is a wonderful tale that shines thru and thru. I would love to see what this filmmaker would do with a large budget. I hope to see more of his work!
