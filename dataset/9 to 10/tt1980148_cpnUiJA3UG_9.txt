"I'll Catch You" was a fun film with some interesting plot twists and a talented cast. The movie kept me interested right from the beginning with characters that were convincing and believable. So many indie films nowadays, especially low budget ones, are unwatchable but "I'll Catch You" had the feeling of a professional cast and Director that were simply lacking a big budget. If you enjoy films with twists, I'd recommend it. It reminded me of "The Grifters" with John Cusack and Angelica Huston. The music was great and fit well with the overall feel of the movie too. I look forward to seeing more from Director Miguel Ceja.
