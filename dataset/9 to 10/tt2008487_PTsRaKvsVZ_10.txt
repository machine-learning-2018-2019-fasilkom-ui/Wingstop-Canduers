it's wacky wild weird funny kinda dumb but amazing and touching that is how you describe what you see when you watch Curse of The Weed eater to some people this may just look like a low budget really cheesy B movie but think again look past all of that and concentrate on the message this movie has to offer it's a message on gods love true relationships saving your self till marriage and how to fully love your spouse through god all while adding a-lot of laughs along the way Curse of The Weed Eater is sure to become the first Christian cult classic ever in the history of films so i encourage you to go and watch it give it a chance and see what god can do
