Cinema is in a state of transition. Film is slowly but surely being replaced and supplanted by Digital techniques. This is a rare gem of documenting because it has been made right in the heart of the transition.Could you imagine if a documentary featuring major filmmakers had been made during the transition from black and white to color? This is essentially the modern iteration of that concept.This film chronicles how digital filming and editing techniques have developed over the last two decades or so and have evolved from being a niche, low quality choice into a much more cost-effective, dynamic and comparable alternative to doing the same work on film.Side By Side will only become more valued as the years go by. One day sooner rather than later film will be gone and everything will be digital. This will be regarded as more of a historical document than a film. It is a snapshot of the state of the industry as it makes the biggest transition it has ever gone through.This is a true testament to the exponential times we live in and should not be missed by any cinema lover.
