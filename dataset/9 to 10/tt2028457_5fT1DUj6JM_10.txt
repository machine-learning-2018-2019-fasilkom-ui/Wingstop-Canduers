This is the best movie ever made.This is movie is the epitome of creative writing and acting. The director is Da Vinci reincarnate, the inventive nature of this genius will astonish generations to come, he has set the bar for for all future movies.It's not really fair to this movie to even compare it to anything else, but i will do a feeble attempt anyway. This would be the equivalent of taking the story from The Godfather, visuals of Avatar (at period height), the humor from Ghostbusters, with twist that puts the 6th sense to shame, and with cinematography that can rival the combined artistry of Star Wars and Jurassic park. Mix it all in a star filled cauldron heated by the dreams of a thousand children, then poured the mix into a diamond lined mold, which would proceed to implode upon contact resulting in a massive explosion of awesome that makes Hiroshima look like a firecracker. Then you repeat this process 23 times, and the result would be Antfarm Dickhole.Do not watch this movie, you will never be able to enjoy another movie again.
