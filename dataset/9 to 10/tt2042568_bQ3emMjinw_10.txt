This is the first film I've feel compelled to write a review for on IMDb. There are only a few movies in history that have impacted me as much.The first time I saw it, it left me feeling empty. While I appreciated the music, the acting, and the cinematography, I couldn't understand why anyone would love this movie (and I am a big Coen fan). After all, it's just scene after scene of a jerk getting beaten up by life with no plot progression and no real reason to care about any of the characters. I came across the movie again on TV and decided to give it another chance.After the second viewing, the movie connected in a big way. After my third viewing of it, it shook me to my core.This movie is almost too realistic to be a movie. It follows none of the conventional "rules" and there is no winner or hero. There's no drama. There's no "silver lining". There's only struggle.For every one Bob Dylan there are 10,000 Llewyn Davis'. Really talented musicians and artists that simply don't catch the lucky break. People go under the radar, under-appreciated and overlooked. People that never make it big and therefore question whether they should be doing it at all (and then, most of time, give up). This is a film for the everyday folk; a beautiful empathetic look at art, music, and everyday struggle.
