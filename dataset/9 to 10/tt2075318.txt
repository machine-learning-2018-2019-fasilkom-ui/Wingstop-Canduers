Two people are forced to extend a one night stand due to a huge traffic jam.This film is the rarest of beasts: a clever comedy that is actually funny.Most of the action is inside the car with the two struggling to pass the time, the rest is flash backs of the drunken night that led up to their predicament.At first I thought they made an unlikely couple, but the chemistry between them is great. Lots of the comedy is observational and very sharp.It is nice to find something that has a little depth but is still light and funny (this is no "Broken Flowers" or "Lost in Translation" yawn fest)If you are a fan of the Seth Rogan kind of humor you may find this a little bland and tame. For me it was perfect.I loved both characters and really got invested. The pace of the film is quite slow and considered. To break up the narrative you get snap shots of the people trapped in the jam around them.A great, subtle, funny, clever little movie.
