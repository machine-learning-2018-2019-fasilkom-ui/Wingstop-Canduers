A great documentary of the emotional journey of the three main characters of "the Travelling Circus", Ring Leader/Kate, Lightning/Emily and Monkey/Brandon while hiking the Appalachian Trail in 2010.If you are looking for a how-to journal on hiking the AT with information on what to bring, and how to pack and what to expect...this film is not for you. This film is truly about the experience and the human emotional response to the journey through physical exhaustion and seclusion.Jason Furrer did an excellent job of editing. He was able to take a pretty repetitive and borderline mundane experience (hiking 2000+ miles in the woods for 5 months?!?!?) and turn it into a story you wanted to hear and an journey you wanted to take. It was fun and upbeat, it was dramatic and explosive, it took you from laughing to crying and back to laughing again - you understood their journey and felt their pain. Topher Wright's music score was dead on - well done.I am an avid outdoor enthusiast, but not a hiker, and this film made me want to through hike the AT!
