The story of Team Rwanda is one of hope and inspiration. It was beautifully filmed and the story flowed quite well. We heard how, sadly and tragically, colonialism contributed in a significant way to the genocide. Fortunately, we saw beyond that to a Rwanda that is trying to rebuild itself. The film shows both the past tragedy and the present/future hope. The Rwandan cyclists are fantastic. Some are charismatic, others are softer, maybe even more vulnerable, but just as engaging. Jack "Jock" Boyer's story is also quite compelling. I only wish we heard more about Tom Ritchey, the Californian cyclist who was the one who made Team Rwanda happen. His story is equally compelling, yet another story of hope rising. But I guess it's too much to fit into one film. I'll read the book for his story. That's my only "complaint" about the movie, which is really a non-complaint. I was fully taken by the cast, the country, and the story.
