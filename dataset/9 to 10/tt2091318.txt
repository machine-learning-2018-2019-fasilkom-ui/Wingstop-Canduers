I had the opportunity to catch this great film at Little Rock Film Festival. Knowing nothing about it going in except the baggage I bring to bear by the term "hipster", I didn't know what to expect. Suffice it to say, I find myself floating in the film's emotional wake days after watching it, in the best of ways. The main character's story is a universal but specific one that resonated with me personally because of the struggle of the main character Brook: existential self-questioning in the face of loss, wrapped up in the contemporary indie art/music scene. I think everyone can relate, and because of the very realistic acting, I think everyone could go on Brook's journey and wonder: does this all matter?The film was a fully professional production in every way, creatively and technically, so I felt that I was in safe hands throughout and could just go along for the emotional journey of the film without distraction. Brook is actively rejecting his friends and loved ones, so feeling disconnected from him at times is understandable, but because I knew he was looking for connection deep down, I was always on board with him and fighting for him. The film taught me that "hipster" is an overused and misapplied label used to marginalize a class of people to which I seem to very much relate but have up till now dismissed. But moreover and more importantly, it seemed to honestly and fully capture that limbo where we can sit, depressed and dismissive, self-pitying, between love and disconnection, experienced through the laughs (Clarke was hilarious) and tears (thanks to terrific support by the three sister characters). Not to mention that the music was awesome and I can't wait to get the album."I Am Not a Hipster" is a genuine, well-crafted, multi-textured, dynamically emotional film experience with an outstanding soundtrack and terrific performances all around. I could feel the love. Highly recommended.
