I have no idea why this has such bad reviews.I found this one of thee most gripping, chilling films I have ever watched.Firstly this is a group of extraordinary, brave, young students whom embarked on an horrific experiment.My hat goes off to them, I would not have the courage to partake in such a dangerous activity.While on the subject of activity, this makes P.A look like Bambi.I am not sure if they are acting or if this is 1000% genuine, but if they are acting they are truly outstanding.Put this on your list of movies to see before you die.Would more than highly recommend for anyone to see.
