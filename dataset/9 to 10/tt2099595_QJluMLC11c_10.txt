I am a huge fan of sports movies that have the human condition common to every person as a key part of the story that is told. The filmmakers of Dave have told the stories of two young men, whose lives collide in an unlikely way resulting in a dynamic impact in their own lives and in the their community. I am drawn to films that show a metamorphosis of a hero, or the discovery of a hidden gift or talent in the characters. I loved the Hollywood movies based on the true stories highlighting coach/athlete relationships, such as Hoosiers and Remember the Titans. This documentary delivers to the viewer the same inspiration to stand up and cheer as the credits roll at the end.
