Director Sean McGarry, working from a script by screen writer Raymond Manrak, has managed to make a riveting horror film with true style. McGarry uses his camera like a scalpel as he sculpts his vision into one of the most suspenseful motion pictures of the last half-decade. With a uniformly excellent cast and terrific dialog, the characters come across as very real and are beautifully realized. Once again, Danielle Harris gives a stunning performance and set the screen ablaze with her talent. She is a truly gifted actress and is simply superb in this film. One element of the motion picture that sets it apart is McGarry's ability to create atmosphere and an environment of true dread and fear. Some of the imagery is intensely haunting and will leave a lasting impression in any audience. With incredible suspense, sensitively realized characters, and a razor sharp screenplay, no one who sees this overwhelming film will forget the unrelenting horror that is Hallows' Eve.
