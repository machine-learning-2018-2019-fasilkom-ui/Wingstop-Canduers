Took my family to see this movie ages 6 to 14 and everyone had fun and loved it. I don't understand the hate coming from the critics about this movie. Did Adam Sandler steal their lollypop or something? I mean the movie is not the greatest film of all time but it was light and fun and had almost no negatives. Why such hatred. I don't get it, but remember that critics like these said that Star Wars would flop and the ET wouldn't make a dime. Someone brought up Siskel and Ebert and I laugh because they hated both ET and Star Wars. Ignore the critics who hate everything and have no fun in life. Go see this movie don't take it seriously and have some fun!!!
