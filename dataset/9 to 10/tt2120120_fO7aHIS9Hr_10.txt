Feeling the need to beef up the score on this movie. I enjoyed it! Yes, it was ridiculous and stupid but I enjoyed it. Paul Blart, The Mall Cop is President of the United States, and Happy Gilmore, the voice of Olaf the Snowman and the children's author that Will Ferrell calls "Elf" are going to attempt to save the world from alien invaders using 1980's video games. I was surprised that my ten and seven year old girls liked it too. However, they had many questions about the references to the '80's pop stars and icons and many of the arcade games meant nothing to them. If you spent any time in the arcades in the early eighties then I am pretty sure you will appreciate this movie!
