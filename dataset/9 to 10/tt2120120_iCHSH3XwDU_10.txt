I sort of knew when I read the first few reviews that this was going to be a good movie. My roommate and I decided to go see it and he was really not interested. Kept commenting that anything under 7.0 is pretty much a waste. After seeing Ant-Man (which is a 7+), I quickly told him to reconsider.We loved it. The story was predictable but really not as much as I thought. The games and action was great. I'm really tired of seeing blood and gore in films. This is family friendly! Adam has his expected humor and while it's nothing to cry about, it's funny. Definitely don't feel like I wasted my time with this. 10 out of 10 to balance things out, but definitely an 8.
