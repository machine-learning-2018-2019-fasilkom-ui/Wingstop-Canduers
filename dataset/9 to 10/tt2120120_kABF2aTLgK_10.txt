Okay, I am actually a little upset I listened to IMDb on this and didn't see it when it first came out.This is my ideal type of movie, a Sci-Fi - Comedy, that is family appropriate.This movie was very well made, graphics were great, and the story line and characters were fun to watch and kept you involved throughout the movie.Its one of the few movies I have seen this year that I actually re-watched and was still loving the movie.Yes, if you are hoping for a curse filled / sexually derogatory movie... you will not be happy with this.But if your looking for a family movie that does not have dora the explore,care bears, barbies, or CGI animals in it... this is a great movie.Perfect for the 20-40 somethings that played the games as kids and now have kids of their own.Wish they would make more movies like this.
