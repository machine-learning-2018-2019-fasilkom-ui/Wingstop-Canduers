I have been interested in this topic on-and-off for 25 years. This documentary is a FABULOUS introduction to the topic. It has a great cast of thespians (all of whom are interested in the topic), great scholars (on both sides of the issue) and some of the best production values I have ever seen in a small independent film...A++One note: This is meant to be an educational film which introduces the topic to the general public. As such, even at 126 minutes, it only scratches the surface of this fascinating area of research. I consider this film to be sort of a world-class appetizer prepared by a Top Chef....and, as such, it will likely serve to stimulate one's appetite for even more "brain food".Warning: Prepare for an intellectual feast...but one which just MAY prove very addicting.
