Masterpiece. This movie is all about life, family, love and passion. Didn't wanted to watch at first, had to be convinced by wife. Boy i was so wrong!Wagner Moura plays a father who tries to save his family, lost them long ago due to his inability to love. Stuck into the system, just like everybody else (work, stress, dark past, so on). During the journey to rescue his son, he then slowly starts to understand how far they got from each other.A man trying to rescue his soul. I'm surprised with the low rating (6.2) here, for it's a big 10!
