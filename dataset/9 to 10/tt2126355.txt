Went with high expectations just from seeing the trailer.And I can say I was not disappointed at all. The storyline was great the effects of the movie was AWESOME. I saw it in 3D and jumped a few times in the movie it kept me on the edge of my seat. I was extremely impressed in the acting and the sets of the movie. It doesn't matter if the science is shaky. We all go to the movie to enjoy them not to be picking it apart over science. I can see this actually happening sometime in the future. The only problem I had was with the tidal wave was that it would have crossed the ocean more than flood the city.Other then that it was a really good movie.
