As a single man and life long bachelor. I can relate with the movie's premise: of a man seeking companionship and adventure. James the main character goes from woman to woman, each with a set of complex offerings. Beautifully made this movie captures the ins and outs of dating and discovering new adventure in the big city. Nothing beats the companionship of a woman or new conquest. Love does comes at a price and so does adventure. This movie harps on the timeless quest of finding the perfect mate in an imperfect world.
