If ever there was a perfect person to be the face of CMT it's Bernadette. Her story is so touching that I dare you not to get emotionally invested in her journey and her cause. Whether she's walking you through her growing up with CMT, the hiding, educating others, losing her father, or living day to day Bernadette makes you care about what she's doing. She makes you want to get involved and to spread the word about CMT. I have the pleasure of knowing Bernadette and she's such a bright shining light in this world. I'm proud to be of any help spreading the word about Charcot Marie Tooth, a disease I'd have known nothing about had it not been for Bernadette and her mission. She's most definitely got a purpose on this Earth and this documentary proves that.
