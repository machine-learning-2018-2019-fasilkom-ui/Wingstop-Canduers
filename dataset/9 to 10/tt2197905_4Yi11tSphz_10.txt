Spoiler ALERT!! Great little low budget (Indy) Sci-fi film that asks a lot of questions (and answers them too) about humans would behave when catastrophe strikes. Maybe the Mayans have it right and this is our future.??Some of the torture scenes are pretty vivid; scalping and removal of body parts. It is not for the faint of heart.And we think there are crazies living in our society now?? Wait till people see the future and chaos that follows.And, maybe like Nick's character we can still redeem ourselves in the eyes of those around us and ourself............Count me as a fan and hope to see this receive some accolades from film festivals her &amp; abroad.
