I was skeptical of this movie at first. It starts a bit slow and I wasn't sure where it was going. People have to give it a chance though. Within the first half hour I was extremely into it. The plot becomes more investing and interesting, and by the end of the movie I can say it had a huge impact on me. It was an extremely moving movie. I hope more films like it are made.The film follows a few characters as they band together against the apocalypse. People may like some over others or have their favorites. But they are all great characters and have their purpose. That's all I'll say about it.
