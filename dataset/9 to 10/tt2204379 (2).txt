This is far more than just a film, it is an experience in itself with the current format they're using for viewings.I purchased the soundtrack before seeing the film &amp; fell in love with it only to fall even harder for the songs &amp; characters when I watched the movie.All the dynamics exist in this dark melodious tale based in an Aesop's Fable type storyline. The cast is dark, funny &amp; makes you glance inward when you find yourself rooting for the devil himself.This is a must see for artists as you see each and every one of the characters betray their passion for the project &amp; become The Devil's Carnival.
