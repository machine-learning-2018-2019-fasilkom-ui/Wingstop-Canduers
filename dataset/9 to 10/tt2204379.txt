I don't normally write these things. This film is very fun and the music alone is enough to move your imagination. You have to enjoy everything from the gritty feel of the carnival to the creepy Doll shop of God. It really pulls you in with a sense of wonder. This is one that nobody should miss. It is and will become a pop culture flick that sneaks into the mainstream society. The performances were amazing. You can never go wrong with the chaos formula that Terrance and Darren have sort of mastered. Emilie Autumn has a fun yet elegantly wicked performance. You can really believe the Ticket-Keeper is a real creature of the pits thanks to the performance of Dayton Callie. Briana Evigan and Sean Patrick Flanery, do astounding job with their characters. Miss this and you will be missing out on great music, story, and a little bit of lesson in morals.
