Upon putting on this film it will grab you by it's talons and suck you in. This was such a fun film to watch, every scene had me laughing more and more. Mamma was played by Joe Grisaffi which has to be one of the FUNNIEST damn roles I have seen in a long time. Jake Byrd gave a fun performance as Elvis, yes Elvis. Now, this is a total b-movie cheese fest. It's totally balls of the wall. Ron Jeremy is in it, and his role is hilarious as always. My only problem with the film is it didn't seem to stay on the plot, and whacky stuff just keeps happening to the fact it gets a bit overwhelming. But all in all, this is a GREAT film, highly recommended for those who love comedy and horror and cheese. 9/10
