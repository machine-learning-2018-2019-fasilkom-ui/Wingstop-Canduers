Inspired by the classic Arcade and later various other systems game of the same name, the movie boasts a predictably simple premise and let's just say the characters are not too complex.. yeah. But this is OK! Nobody will see this movie for compelling characters and dramatic scenes. The cast is mostly just passable, with the exception of Johnson(who always rocks!) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan who turns in one hell of an entertaining government agent, and of course George the gorilla is also one cool dude. It is like a live action Saturday morning cartoon! It's fun, high octane action with some pretty sweet scenes and solid effects. If you want to see a popcorn flick then look no further, if you remember the games nostalgia might be included!
