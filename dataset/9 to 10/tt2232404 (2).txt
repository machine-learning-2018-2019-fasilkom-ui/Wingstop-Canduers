Diamonds to Dust is simply brilliant from start to finish , well produced and above all made with love from the whole team , It will be a cult classic in years to come but don't take my word .. Frank the producer has crafted and created some excellent performances from a stellar cast who really act their parts well , Jayne Mansfield in many ways have being forgotten in terms of the power of Monroe but Rob &amp; Frank have reminded us why she was a vital part of that era and more importantly why she should not be forgotten .. The movie gives an insight into how someone in that period could create a brand and stay in the top 10 of stars .. Its worth watching for that alone and lets not forget if Jayne were alive today I am sure she would have had her own reality show .. From Diamonds to Dust reminds us all that Jayne Mansfield may have led a troubled life in many respects but what a life in so many short years Its never easy to take on a real life bio but it proves done well it works watch it yourself , I have many times and its wonderful
