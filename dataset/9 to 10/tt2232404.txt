This independent low budget film is an interesting and touching tells of Jayne Mansfield's life, the voluptuous bombshell that tragically died too young. It shows the typical cope mechanism of some Hollywood stars of that era; alcoholism, pill taking, drugs and extra-marital affairs to alleviate the pressures of packed work schedule to make a living for the entire family. Very creative and entertaining. I enjoyed it very much.
