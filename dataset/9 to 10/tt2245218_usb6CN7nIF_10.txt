This is a wonderful documentary of all the work that goes into making an excellent haunted adventure. The story explains the heartache and trials of getting everything together for the opening night. I had no idea so much went in to the making of a great haunt from the casting, sets, costumes and the incredible physical and financial requirements of the project. It depicts the trials of working together day and night as a team and the downfalls of keeping everybody focused on the end result.This documentary is educational, fun and sometimes downright eerie and is a must see for all who have ever gone to a haunted house. Fantastic!
