The reviews I've read about this film all mention the astounding depth, scope and variety of its animation, most mention the ugliness of its characters, and most mention the "humanness" of the story. I've not yet seen a single mention of Chris Sullivan's clear, clean and carefully crafted sound track. And - even more troubling to me - I've not seen a single mention of the screenplay. I don't recall hearing a single swear word in this film. Even Ida's dementia-fueled "inappropriate statements" about sex and female sexual anatomy are worthy of a Catholic "how to" treatise for straight couples seeking divine sanction for their upcoming nuptials. Squeaky clean. But to me, a faithful fan of David Milch's poetic and sonorous soliloquies penned for his deeply intelligent and vocally expressive "Deadwood" characters, some of the most beautiful and enjoyable aspects of "Consuming Spirits" are the sublime verbal tangents that Earl Gray takes on his radio program. Of course these are a small portion of the film - but worthy of attention, mention and emulation.
