Tonight I saw "On Your Mark, Get Set, Mow!" at the DC film festival and I have to say I was really impressed. The film really captures the nature of the people racing. This movie is more about the triumph of the human spirit and what a community can do when they ban together. I can not imagine what it would be like to live with Huntington's Disease, but this movie gave me a little insight to that world and how horrible a disease that it is. The family featured shows courage that I think a few people have, and it is really captured by the film maker.This film is a great education tool to learn about Huntington's Disease, but it isn't overly depressing. It strikes the right balance with its many sub stories and great footage of racing that until this movie I didn't know about. You will laugh, and you will cry. Mostly though, you will be uplifted. I am so glad I took a chance on going to see this today. This was a great film. Do not miss a chance to see this documentary.
