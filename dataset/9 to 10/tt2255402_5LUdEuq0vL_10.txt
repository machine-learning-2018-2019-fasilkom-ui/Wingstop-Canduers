Wow! This is a high-end, creative documentary film! Scott and Jen -- all the best as you continue to create awareness, educate, promote change and foster community dialogue as well as entertain and inspire. I'm awestruck as I consider the journey you've been on over the past 4+ years to get to this point. I can only imagine where the next 4 years will take Imagine Education. There is such a need for this discussion (on why kids are failing math in the U.S.) to continue. But not only discussion - we need an awakening. I hope your campaign to raise money to distribute The Biggest Story Proglem to every middle school in the U.S. is successful. The movie was moving (frustrating and hopeful). Thank you for your time and your incredible personal investment.
