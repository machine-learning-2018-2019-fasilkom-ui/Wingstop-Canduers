Love Is All You Need?, is a great film with an inspiring story of living and dealing with discrimination of all kinds. I think everyone and anyone can relate to being discriminated against at least once in their life. I don't usually cry during movies, but this one is real tear jerk-er. This movie will change lives and hopefully educate those who watch it. I think this is one of the greatest movies ever written. Discrimination has no boundaries against color, age, race, sexuality, level of education, weight, height, religious beliefs, styles, Etc. It really opens your eyes to all the hate that still lives in such a diverse world. I think this film can be an educational tool for years to come.
