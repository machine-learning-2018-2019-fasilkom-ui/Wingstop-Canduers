When I was watching, I was expecting and worried at the same time that this movie would wind up the same way as the 1000 movies I have already seen about courtship and the drama and weak constructions of a relationship that follows that in a movie.But this movie doesn't have any of the routine non-sense that other movies have and the ending could not have been better.I know all the negative reviews preceding this, but they have not seen all the boring movies which always have the same ending. I 'm really happy that this movie doesn't end like that.The director has done a great job in making the movie as lively as possible. In this movie, I felt like the actors were was not even acting, It felt so real rather than the cliché crap we see on other movies.
