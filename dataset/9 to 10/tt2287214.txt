I am really shocked at all the bad reviews for this movie. This is by far the best version of Dracula I have seen. And I pretty much enjoy them all. Granted Jon Voight wasn't the best Van Helsing and I agree about the cheap CGI. In those days it really was all about God and Christianity which is why I think this unexplored version to be the best retelling. It has all the elements for a classic. I liked seeing Dracula as a blond. The actor was amazing! He is everything we would come to expect from Dracula. He makes this movie awesome. I love the twists in the plot. In my humble opinion this is every vampire lovers must see movie.
