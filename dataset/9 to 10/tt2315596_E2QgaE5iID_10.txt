If I had read this logline first, I would have passed on watching this incredible film. It is NOT an action drama about a hitman seeking revenge, and anyone thinking it is will be sorely disappointed (likely the reason for the low rating and some of the negative reviews here). It is a poignant, gritty crime drama about a mob enforcer seeking redemption. Heartbreaking, haunting and hopeful in the end, it is worth watching for the performance of Elle Fanning alone. The characters are well-drawn, the acting superb, the writing is compelling and the directing is intelligent - focussing on the aftermath and reactions to acts of extreme violence rather than going for visual shock value. The soundtrack also deserves a mention, supporting the plot without overwhelming it, in particular Fanning's a capella impromptu solo. This film deserves way more attention than it got and if it suffers from anything, it's poor marketing. Highly recommended.
