I remember watching the trailer earlier but didn't recall much of the movie apart from it starring Ben Foster and Elle Fanning, which was enough to establish its worth for me but unfortunately there was/is no buzz about it within movie circles. Although this is not Mélanie Laurent's directorial debut but I am sure her skills beyond an actress will be noted hereafter.Both the leads are absolutely amazing, and little Fanning proves her well-deserved critical acclaim.The scene where Ben Foster confronts Elle Fanning at the motel is my favorite, the emotions and character portrayal reminds me of Emma Stone's Oscar nominated confrontation with Michael Keaton in Bird Man.It is really unfortunate that Ben Foster has remained under the radar for most of his career, and it is good to see two of his movies this year ("Leave no Trace" being the earlier) after some mainstream recognition in "Hell or High Water"The plot is action/ drama but it's not your regular type, as can be expected by the cast. How the characters and story unfolds will keep you glued, so if you are here being indecisive just watch it and thank me later.
