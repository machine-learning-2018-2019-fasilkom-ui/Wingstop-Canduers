01/31/2019 I can't encourage other viewers strongly enough as to the quality, the excellence of this movie. The actor Ben Foster plays the criminal. The actress Elle Fanning plays the helpless teenage girl caught up in a web of crime as well her young daughter. The three are the focus, the center of this movie. Every other actor/actress are just supporting cast members for the three, everyone brings reality to this movie, as does the writing/directing, the dialog, the visual nuances of every scene. Not a mistake one (I'm very nit picky regarding visual details), throughout the entire length of the movie. Absolute perfection for you and for I as viewers, from the very beginning to anticlimactic ending and best of all????? .... no fakey, let's have a cry baby moment Hollywood ending. Bon Appetit
