I started the movie with the idea that I already new the story. Boy, was I wrong! As a Fan of the Union and now a new member of the Sons of Ben I really enjoyed this movie. I must say it was funny and it was more about hopes,dreams,and those never giving up attitudes that inspire us to dream a dream then about soccer. It humanized the personalities involved in the the creation of the Supporters Group and of those operating the Philadelphia Union. I think any fan of any sports team could find something inspiring and entertaining in this documentary.You may cry, I know you will laugh. If your from Philadelphia You will surely say, "ah-ha" to some of the quotes in this film. James Lockerbie
