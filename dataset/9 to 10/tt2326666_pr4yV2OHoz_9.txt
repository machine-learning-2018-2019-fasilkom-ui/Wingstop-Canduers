I love "making-of" movie documentaries and this one was a fun ride. I have been waiting for the 11:11 movie for a long time, so when I heard they released a making-of documentary, I was all about it. This movie held my interest throughout and it was great to see how indie movies are made versus Hollywood movies. They have smaller crews and have to be more inventive than bigger films. I especially liked the transformation between the 2004 filming and the 2009 stuff. It shows how everyone has grown, both in age and experience. These filmmakers work very hard just to get their movie made only to have it shelved...perfect title. It's a shame the actual movie didn't get finished but this documentary is the next best thing.
