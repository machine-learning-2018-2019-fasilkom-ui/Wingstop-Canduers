Loved this darling movie. It is well written, flows nicely, the camera work, settings and acting is flawless. An absolute gem. It is sort of along the same storyline of a Dickens novel. I love finding sweet movies like this. This is one you can watch with the whole family and not have one cringe at all! So do yourself a favor and watch it. I am going to watch it again with my whole family in attendance. Our grandparents have told us stories of how special it was to receive an orange at Christmas and many of us put them out now as a tradition. It is fun to see how excited the children so long ago were over something we take for granted. What a stark contrast to what our children now a days get excited for at Christmas. If all they got was an orange boy would they be disappointed. Bravo to the cast &amp; crew. Sad movies like this don't get more attention.
