I had no idea who or what The Green Girl is or was. Now I find myself having seen it three times, each more interesting and fulfilling than the last. Unexpectedly, one of the most interesting things was learning more fully about an entire industry through one person. About movies, television, about it's people, actors, directors, related persons, history, literal behind the scenes interactions, meaning generally and specifically, than I ever conceive imaginable. At the same time much broader and much narrower than I could have ever thought possible. Then comes the surprising shocker of all as a documentary. It hit me with what I expect from real entertaining invigorating movies. It has drama about drama about drama. It elicits feelings and emotion about the very people and things that are themselves initiated and formulated to elicit feelings and emotions in the first place! first about the subject person, secondly about the people intimately acquainted with the subject person. And also, not the least, about the person, people, background, processes, contacts, research methods of who made this movie / documentary; and how this movie / documentary came to be born in the first place, and how things unfolded as it was made. It has that ineffable something that keeps bringing me back to see it again. I might not be done yet. I might see it A forth time. I already know I'm going to see Few Options a second time. Touching, insightful, educational, and interesting. Yes, both of them, that's interesting, and perhaps even strange. - Thank you again, George
