It was fascinating to learn about the amazing little known life of the actress known mostly as the Star Trek "Green Girl." You do not need to be a Star Trek fan to relate to this documentary. There is actually surprising little about her being that character because the rest of her life was much deeper, and more intricate and interesting. Mr. Pappy did an excellent and difficult job of putting together the visual and interview pieces to reveal and explore the unknown and multiple sides of this beautiful actress accomplished in so much more than just her wonderful acting. Things that should have been known by more people while she was alive. I was surprisingly moved and glad to get to know her in this nostalgic experience, yet sadly after she's gone. I recommend seeing it.
