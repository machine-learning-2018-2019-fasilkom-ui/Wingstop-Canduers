Oculus is a nail biting thrill ride which artfully takes us on a complex journey of the two main characters and it charts how their lives have morosely ended up at this salient moment in time. We are frequently taken back to the past and brought back to the present with an ease that defines the characters and the film. There is little in the way of location and this adds to the desperation of the characters as they live out their lives constrained by an evil power. The whole cast are exceptional and their performance draws you deeper and deeper into the film, and has you mentally willing to help these poor souls in anyway you can. The direction and script are outstanding and intelligent without being all smart ass! An excellent movie and a must for movie fans who enjoy losing themselves in film.
