I really enjoyed this movie. It did exactly what it intended to do, entertain. The pace was just right for me. The character relationships were, for the most part, believable. I don't think they set out to win an Academy Award, but more to make a quality action film of this genre that would entertain a wide variety of tastes. The ladies will like this along with their men. The only weak spot was the character of Miller and that was more the writing than the acting. Also I cringe when an actors lines have to explain the plot instead of the story itself doing the job but that was very minor in this case. Marie Avgeropoulos is new to me and I want more. I rated it 9 because I got more than I expected. Truthfully I hope there's more. I can easily see how a series of films based from this could be possible.
