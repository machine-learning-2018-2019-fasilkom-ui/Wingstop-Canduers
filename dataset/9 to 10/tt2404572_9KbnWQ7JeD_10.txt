Every person should watch and make their own conclusion. Regarding African, African American and European there is a lot of truth in it. I'm not an historian or scientist but for sure I read a lot of books and research a pretty amount of documentations regarding our evolution. It sometimes feel like black man in general are curse and I ask myself why? So for the comment above who believed that is false, why do say that? What are your facts and finding? Please look around again and judge with your heart and not your repulsion.NB: Fantastic documentary for the black soul which is really down. We all need and up-lifting spirit. Thank youYour comments should be based on fact and not just because bible says so, after all its just a book that man has written. I believe what is written in stone!
