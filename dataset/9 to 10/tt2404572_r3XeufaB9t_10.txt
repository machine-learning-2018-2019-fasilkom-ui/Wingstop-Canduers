This is so important for not only black people, but every human being. It's crazy how there are things that I was taught in elementary school, and middle school that is like polar opposite, or in stark contrast to what we learn today. Is not that the information was incorrect, but it was also limited. It's like there was an attempt to mis-educate us, or limit us to the information about ourselves.

Some how all teachers have to come back to history.
