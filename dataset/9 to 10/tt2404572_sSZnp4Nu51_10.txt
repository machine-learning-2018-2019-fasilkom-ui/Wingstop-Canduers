For every black person out there who wonders where we came from....Or if there is more to our culture than just slavery, hip hop, and the civil rights movements... This documentary is a good start. I can't even being to describe how eye opening this documentary is!! So much about our history has been covered up and hidden. After watching this, I know why!! Everything truly is not what it appears /not what we have been taught (or indoctrinated with). Please take the time to sit down and watch this documentary. Black people need to wake up and realize who we really are, not who someone else made us out to be!! I don't know what's up with the rating system, but it's definitely not a 4 caliber documentary!!!! Whoever rated it so low obviously still are trying to hide the truth!!
