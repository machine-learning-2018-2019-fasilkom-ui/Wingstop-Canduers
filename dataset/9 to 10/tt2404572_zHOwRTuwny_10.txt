This part 2 documentary is totally awesome and very informative. It answers questions regarding artifacts, and ancient structures built by people of color all over the world. People who are so rooted in the concept of white supremacy will find this information very hard digest and will dismiss it as pure conjecture or comedy as one "Scottish" reviewer already has. As mentioned in the film there is only one race on the planet and that that is the Human race. Every human has something in humanity to celebrate. This is truly a triumph and great contribution to Africa, Native Americans, African Americans and all human beings in general.
