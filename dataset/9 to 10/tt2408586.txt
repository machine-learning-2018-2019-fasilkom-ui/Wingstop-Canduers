"Growing Cities" is a documentary film directed by Dan Susman with cinematography by Andrew Monbouguette on the subject of urban farming in the United States. I loved this film. I loved it for it's simplicity and goodness of heart - in regard to Susman's easy-going personality and the open, honest and inspiring nature of the farmers/gardeners interviewed. The film brings forward the simple truth that growing one's own food is not just about food but also about bringing communities together, empowering individuals and communities to take control of what they eat, ensuring that the food they grow is healthy and the techniques used to grow it are earth-friendly. I found "Growing Cities" to be very uplifting. In a culture that has dissected itself from the roots of our existence - the earth - and is suffering the consequences of that separatist mindset, visible in rising crime, drug addiction, extreme wealth disparity, extreme poverty, homelessness and a slew of abusive behaviors, "Growing Cities" shows people across the country from literally all walks of life coming together to grow their own food and teach the young people in the community how to have this simple kind of empowerment over their lives, transforming the individuals and the communities. I applaud the makers and supporters of this film and look forward to seeing more films like this one made in the future. I also look forward to seeing "Growing Cities" on PBS stations and major movie outlets such as NetFlix as well as Internet platforms such as iTunes. We need to have more of these types of films and less of the sludge of mindless "entertainment" that is so pervasive in our culture. Kudos to the "Growing Cities" film crew and all its supporters!
