This movie has a very well-developed central character, great supporting cast and surprisingly solid soundtrack for an independent production. Without going into spoiler details, the movie deals with life's unavoidable realities -- a long lost, but never forgotten past, the redemptive quality of human relationships, our inescapable mortality and inexhaustible ability to love -- it treats all these subjects with equal parts humor, dignity and somberness. It's a solid film that I'd recommend...and I'm used to watching much more big budget, yet less substantive Hollywood productions.
