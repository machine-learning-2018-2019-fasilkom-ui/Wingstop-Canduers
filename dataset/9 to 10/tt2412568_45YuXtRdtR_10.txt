This is a very powerful and gripping movie about the life of Rich Mullins. It is not just another "life story" about a famous person. It not only shows Rich's life but it ministers to all who see it. It not only brought tears to my eyes throughout the movie, but to the people throughout the church at that showing. I would recommend everyone to see this movie because it brings you to the realization that God loves all of us, even though we are not perfect. It is definitely a must see, powerful,inspiring, enlightening, and ministering movie for Christians and non-Christians alike. If you only purchase one DVD this year, it should be Ragamuffin!
