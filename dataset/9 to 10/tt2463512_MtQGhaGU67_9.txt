This is a very well-done, gentle romantic movie, with excellent acting, especially from Kristen Wiig. Family members and I had not heard of Ms. Wiig before seeing this movie recently on a movie channel. We understand now that she is mainly a comedic actor, so it was good to see this movie without knowing that in advance. This movie seems geared more toward an audience from the South or Midwest. Members of my family have hired young female caregivers like Johanna Parry (Ms. Wiig's character, who is the movie's main character) to take care of our parents before their death. So we can probably better relate to Ms. Parry than many folks who might consider her a little odd. This movie does something that Hollywood rarely does: it shines a light (and a sympathetic one at that) on working-class American white people. We know of working-class white women like Ms. Parry, who are not "ambitious" (in the traditional sense of the word), and thus seem content not having many impressive possessions, work titles, social status, etc. So to us, the movie is quite realistic in this sense. Our only criticisms of the movie: the ending seems a bit rushed (is there a director's cut?); and, knowing some working-class men with drug problems, we felt that actor Guy Pearce was too handsome, polished, well-built, and well-spoken to play Ken, the movie's principal male character. Actors like Edward Norton would have been more believable in the role. But, on the whole, we highly recommend this movie, and hope it draws a large viewer-ship via cable TV.
