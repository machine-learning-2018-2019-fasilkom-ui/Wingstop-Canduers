This too, for me, was initially so dreadful (and I thought... potentially depressing) a story (initially) that I stopped watching it after about 20 minutes...BUT!!! A couple months later, I watched Kristen Wigg in "Bridesmaids" (a second time, this time to observe Ms. Wigg)... and realized (in addition to her talents shown in "Welcome to Me") that Kristen was actually a POWERFUL actress, with a BROAD range of talent and acting ability...SO... I gave it another chance, last night, realizing that this NON-major NON-Hollywood production was a personal acting choice for Kristen, for the real CHALLENGE it presented...!!! and I'm SO very glad I did.I started over, watching it from the beginning, with a new understanding of the role.Her line "I have what I want." was such a moving moment (and resonated as a point of strength and stability that I happen to really need (a nightmare boss) to realize in MY life) that it became something of a mantra, to put my mind to rest, last night.Now, having watched Kristen Wigg perform in "Girl Most Likely" and "The Skeleton Twins", I'm simply filled with admiration for what I consider her phenomenal talent, as a versatile actress.I want to add that I thought Guy Pierce was FLAWLESS, and (little downer here) Nick Nolte's facial features... were (how to put this...) disturbing and distracting.Otherwise... a TERRIFIC Film!!!
