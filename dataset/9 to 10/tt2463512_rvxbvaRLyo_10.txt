Kristen Wiig reveals incredible depth and range in this Oscar-worthy performance about an unfulfilled care-giver aiding a widowed father with a drug problem, a troubled teen coming of age and a grandfather trying to deal with failing health while keeping the family together. Set aside your comedic expectations based on Wiig's earlier work -- this is a drama with a full range of nuanced feeling - humour, wit, longing and fulfilment in the classic style of Canada's Nobel prize-winning author Alice Munro, whose short story was masterfully adapted to this screenplay. There are no lightweights in the cast either: veteran character actors Guy Pearce, Nick Nolte and Jennifer Jason Leigh deliver rock solid performances. This felt like a Sarah Polleyproduction: no overtly grand shots or scenes but every character cast perfectly, every performance and shot building a deep, rich reverb and feeling. A fantastic film.
