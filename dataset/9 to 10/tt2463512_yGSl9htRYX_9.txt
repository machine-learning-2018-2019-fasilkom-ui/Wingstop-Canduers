I was able to view to this movie via PPV before it hits theaters. I had no prior knowledge of the movie, and honestly pretty low expectations based on the description given, but I thought wth, I'll give it a try. I am SO glad I did. This movie was an unexpected beauty. I loved seeing both Kristen Wiig and Guy Pearce in very different roles than they typically play. This film is understated, it's slow going yet the pace feels perfect. There may not be any HUGE moments, but there are a couple "really good" ones. This film starts out with an almost sad feeling, but totally goes in an unexpected direction, and is so much more than it's description. It offers amazing yet gentle insight into various relationships, real-life scenarios, and excellent acting. I loved Nick Nolte in this. All around, this film left a good feeling inside my heart. It's about embracing imperfection, loving people for who they are, yet showing them how much more than can be if someone believes in them. At least, that's what I took away from it. So much more than I expected, love it! I am quite picky about movies, especially slower-moving independent films..but this- I loved. Well worth the money and time. 9/10
