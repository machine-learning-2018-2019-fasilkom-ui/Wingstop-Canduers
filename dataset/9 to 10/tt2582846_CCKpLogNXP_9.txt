I was touched by the concepts and situations on this film, being myself a survivor of 48 chemotherapy treatments, I can somehow understand the feelings.Is not a pretentious film, however full of little moments that creates a very good and convincing environment.I like both main rolls. The story is completely credible, it can happen any time to anyone.It is an Ode for Life, it tell us that "We can and should have moments of infinite joy within a limited time" It is our choice!I liked very much this film!
