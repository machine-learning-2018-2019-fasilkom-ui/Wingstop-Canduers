There is nothing about this movie I would change given the chance, and that's why I give it 10/10. I'm not sure when this movie is supposed to take place &amp; love that it didn't matter. Marty is the gutsiest slacker on earth, taking advantage of the system everywhere he goes. The camera spends a lot of time in view of his face, which makes it all that much more apparent how withdrawn and composed he is in his scams, and effective when we notice him displaying fear &amp; rage &amp; doubt as things begin to close in on him. One of my favorite parts of this movie was Marty's selfish, awkward &amp; mismatched relationship with his coworker and friend(?). Napoleon Dynamite-ish humor there. A scene where they snack of Bugles brought me to tears. Yay for junk food &amp; horror culture. Yay for this movie. Release it to DVD already so I can show all my friends.
