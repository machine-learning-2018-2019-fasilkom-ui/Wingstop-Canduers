The Debt is a financial drama that I recommend watching at least once. Novice director Barney Elliott teams up with executive producer Christine Vachon and a talented, star studded cast to deliver his first feature film. Set partly in New York and Peru, The Debt tracks three distinct narratives on the path to meeting each other. Throughout each of their stories, the characters face financial and moral issues that force them to make tough, life- changing decisions. The complexity of the film is the best part about it. It allows the actors to immerse themselves into their roles and challenges the audience to think more deeply. In one narrative, Stephen Dorff's character Oliver must make challenging decisions to either secure a large international business deal or help Peruvian natives keep their land. On the flip side in Lima, the talented Elsa Olivero plays Maria Ruiz, a poor nurse who is desperately struggling to care for her sickly mother. The struggles of life and business are exposed to show that even decent people will make bad choices when pushed to the brink. If you like emotionally charged films, I recommend adding this one to your summer watch list.
