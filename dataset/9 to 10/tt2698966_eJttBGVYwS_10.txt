What a surprise, what a surprise !I thought this was going to be a financial thriller and ended up watching one of the best films in my lifetime.Anyone who has lived in a developing country will experience a rollercoaster of emotions on seeing this film as the story could apply to absolutely any developing country. And what a story. Ten minutes into the film and I started saying "What a fantastic film - who made this film ?", and I carried on saying that at regular intervals throughout the film. This film has so many layers that if you understand everything it is trying to portray you simply want to meet the Writer/Director. For the Writer/Director to hail from New York and yet understand all the subtelties, consequences, and tragedies of life for the common person in a developing country demonstrates a unique capacity for observation and, critically, empathy.This is a cinematically beautiful, sad, brutally accurate, tense, but also uplifting film, all at the same time. This film should have been taken to Cannes and it would have won the top prize - someone missed a marketing trick there.Still - easily one of the best films I have ever seen. Watch it - you won't regret it.
