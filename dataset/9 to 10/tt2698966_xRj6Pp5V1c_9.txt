The Debt features riveting talent all across the board. Blade's Stephen Dorff and The Bourne Ultimatum's David Strathairn shine as the bankers who attempt to acquire land from a Peruvian family. Barney Elliott has managed to put together a moving cast that portrays the suspenseful story; with a special mention for Elsa Olivero who gives a heartbreaking performance as a nurse who tries desperately to care for her sick mother. The narrative is topical as it involves three separate stories that intertwine because of a deal to buy some land in Peru by New York financiers. In my opinion, newcomer Barney Elliott showcases great direction and writing as presented by a surprising turn the film makes, which caught me off guard. Furthermore, the film is shot beautifully as Peru is such a vibrant setting. It's great to see an independent movie that utilizes every frame from start to finish and kept me on edge. I recommend that any film lover see this feature.
