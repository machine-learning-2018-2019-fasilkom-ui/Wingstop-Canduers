This movie was awesome, I was impressed by the makeup. Well done! Most films have an inability to portray a good scare but this was great. Special effects were good! A classic thriller with some of the best chase scenes, the script is good, the performances are good, if you're a fan of suspense, you've probably watched this movie.Kylie Winters, a bullied and self-loathing teen, reluctantly agrees to babysit at an isolated country mansion on Halloween night. When a small boy in a pig mask appears at the door trick- or-treating, Kylie's night transforms into a horrifying and violent cat-and-mouse game. She must go beyond what she ever thought possible if she and the children are to survive the night.
