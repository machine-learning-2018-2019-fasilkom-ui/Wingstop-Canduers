I've been watching a ton of mediocre to terrible thriller/horror movies lately and this one was a nice fresh surprise. Perhaps it's because I'm a female and it was directed by a female. I don't understand why the other reviewers are calling the main character a dumb sleaze from the first scene and that made them not care about her? It was clear that she was not that type of girl from the start. The bullying and slut-shaming she received made her more likable for me because it was undeserved. Her day started out pretty awful and then she went on the babysitting gig from hell. That house was really interesting and different from the classic two-story suburban home we're used to seeing in usual babysitting thrillers. From the moment the killers made their first real appearance, I felt extreme tension throughout the rest of the movie. There were definitely some fresh twists with these villains. Also, the female lead never made those common mistakes you usually see in these types of movies, she moved quickly and used smart tactics against the psycho killers. She started out as a mousy doormat and became a real fighter by the finale. At the end of the credits there is a disclaimer that says it was inspired by actual events but the characters' names have been changed etc... That was a surprise to me and made me like the film even more.
