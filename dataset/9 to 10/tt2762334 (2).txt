To be honest ..I for on really enjoyed the movie..Maybe it was because i went in with low expectations after reading all the mixed reviews.. ? Not sure.But really, other than the long dancing numbers which i found to be really time consuming,I really enjoyed the story line,the acting and the characters.You would honestly find me laughing most of the time..(if i wasn't forwarding the songs that is).I loved every character in the movie especially 'Angad' and 'Peter'...they were really hilarious.Overall,Great Rom-com for a fun evening :)
