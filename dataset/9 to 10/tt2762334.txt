An excellent performance by Varun Dhawan and Ileana D'Cruz but a below average performance by Nargis Fakhri.This will make you laugh all the time during movie but having a average plot.I thought it was a predictable love story weaved around Varun Dhawan, Ileana D'Cruz and Nargis Fakhri. Before interval, Varun, Ileana and Arunoday's love triangle is in focus, while I wonder when Nargis will walk into the scene. When she does appear towards the interval, we are left wanting for more. The full-on David Dhawan affair starts in the second half, when Varun Dhawan romances both Nargis and Ileana simultaneously.all though having a lot of twist its a nice experience and full on fun and more just a Paisa Vasul movie.
