I enjoyed this film very much. It was terrifying, full of gore and even a splash of dark magic, but still grounded in human emotion and completely tasteful. The violent and sexual scenes were relevant to the story and well executed. And there were moments of subtle humor that gave a momentary reprieve from the heavy atmosphere. The acting was strong - I believed every scream. David Willis was exceptional as Buzz, possibly my favorite character. This film is one of the best of its genre that I've seen in a while; I was beginning to think there weren't any good horror writer/directors left out there. I highly recommend seeing it to anyone who can handle graphic images.
