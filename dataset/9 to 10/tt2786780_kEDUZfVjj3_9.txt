I loved this movie. It kept me on the edge of my seat. It's a fun, scary, intense movie with plenty of gore, terrorized victims, sex, drugs, blood and even some dark humor, mostly delivered by "Buzz" who was my favorite character. He's a character who you love to hate. His sidekick is a piece of work too. They draw you in and make you want to watch them. All the acting is good however. I liked the setting too. This movie is not your typical horror flick, so stay with it. There's an interesting twist here. This has all the makings of a cult classic. I can't wait to see what this director does next. I like his twisted style! Warning: Not for the timid!!!
