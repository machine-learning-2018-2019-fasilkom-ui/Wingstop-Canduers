This is my first IMDb review, I really liked this movie that's why I felt the urge to let the people know how amazing It is! Firstly I want to tell you that I had my doubts, I din't know if it was going to be any good. Luckily the doubts disappeared as soon as I saw the first scene, I'm not going to spoil it but it was an amazing intro to a brilliant movie which is always keeping you interested and intrigued.Disney has a unique, almost magical way of touching your soul, and it did just that in this movie. It will make you feel like a kid again, no matter how old you are. It will make you feel sad, it will make you feel happy and it will make you feel angry. I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried a lot and also caught myself yelling at the screen! You share the character's emotions and you are feeling like you belong in the story. Another thing that helps with that is the kid who plays remarkably good, and the dragon that feels like real.I strongly recommend it to you. Anyone can watch it. Your kids, you and even the older people can enjoy this amazing fairy-tale.
