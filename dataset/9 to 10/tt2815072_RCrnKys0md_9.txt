For a low budget, Indigenous works out really well. The movie moved along at a nice pace, the characters were all very natural, and could act their parts with conviction (something usually lacking in low budget films).The plot was quite good, based around the idea of a group of young tourists a bit bored with the standard fare on offer at the beach resort. They are told of a wonderful waterfall, deep in the jungle, but are also warned about the danger lurking there... blood thirsty beasts, the Chupacabra.Yes, young folks make stupid choices all the time, nevermind how many warnings about the risks. So off this group go to find the find of their lives, an isolated and idyllic waterfall deep in the jungle.The action begins not long after reaching the waterfall &amp; pool. When night falls, character by character are in grave danger of being picked off by the Chupacabra. These actual creatures looked really good too. Plus the blood &amp; gore was realistic. As this type of movie goes, I'd say it's well worth a watch.
