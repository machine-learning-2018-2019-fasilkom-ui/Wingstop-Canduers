I believe that the filmmakers called this film a "horror" because they were not sure how to describe it. Indeed, this film may be hard to categorise, but, rather than being a drawback, this actually speaks volumes about this film's strengths.I went away from this film feeling mildly euphoric, and distinctly entertained. With just the right amount of drama, tension, gore and comedy, this was what I would consider to be a perfect film.It's certainly not "scary" in the way that horror movies tend to be; and is more like a thought-experiment, or an exploration into the nature of humanity. However, it doesn't feel preachy, and has enough twists and turns in the plot to leave the viewer amazed.It goes without saying that the actors in this movie are all absolutely amazing, and the dialogue always feels realistic and to the point. Beautifully shot and well-handled, this indie film is better than most modern Hollywood film offerings.
