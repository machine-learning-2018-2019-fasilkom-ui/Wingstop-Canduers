Extraordinary movie,with some very lively and ''to be true'' acting .the girl,she is nameless brought ahead by a very beautiful Kira Waterhouse, and the man called Viktor, who has a braindamage due to an accidenta as a child,are brought together as a deed of destiny. this film has got nearly everything.emotions,fun,irony,grief,sorrow and death. if you would like a special x-mas gift,this is the one to see
