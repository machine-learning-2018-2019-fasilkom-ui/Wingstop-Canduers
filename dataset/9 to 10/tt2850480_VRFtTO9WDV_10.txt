Before I actually review this film I must admit I am no critic, but a mere film lover who has never been more impressed by a low budget drama as I was by this title. I felt compelled to write a (my first) review, since this film has undeserved low ratings. Indeed, because of that I started watching with low expectations, looking for a relatable love story and escapism. What I got instead was a wild emotional ride, poignant at places (especially the end), but otherwise utterly and sincerely full of hope. (SPOILERS, maybe) The movie succeeds in teaching the audience a few important lessons, as I see it: how there is good in people, how loneliness 'kills', how, in the face of death, petty conflicts vanish and how tragedy unites people. Moreover, I must say I'm amazed how this film managed to keep secret the name of a primary character and make it irrelevant, really. On another note, for those saying that the girl fell for the big fella, I must disagree. Their relationship is one of pure friendship and that is another kind of love. Other meaningful relationships, and arguably quite complex, that are well depicted in the movie are that of the brothers, that of the wife-lover, husband-wife and even husband-lover. Finally, I cannot recommend this movie more for those who want to feel pity and admiration, joy and regret, love and sorrow. 10/10 not for its cinematic features, but for a good story and delivery.
