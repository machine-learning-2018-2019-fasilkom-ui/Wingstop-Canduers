This is a phenomenal picture. I haven't enjoyed a film this much in a long time, and I have no friends, so I watch a lot of movies. It's a refreshing, uniquely written, feel good story that I'm not going to explain. Just watch it. The entire experience felt effortless and real and easily absorbed.The acting was outstanding, especially Dash Mihok as Victor and Suki Waterhouse, as "The Girl", who also did a commendable job. Their relationship was both entirely believable and adorable. Let's not forget about the score. It was literally perfect. Rich in atmosphere, charming, and perfectly suited for each scene. I found myself "Shazamming several songs throughout the movie.It's a real shame a movie of this quality goes under the radar because there isn't an "A-list" actor involved. In fact, too many movies are overshadowed by A-list actors and the the roles they are famous for.For example, had Victor been played by Anthony Hopkins instead of Dash Mihok, I'm pretty sure I would have been wondering when Hannibal Lector was going to bite the girl's face off, rather than fall innocently in love with her, if you catch my drift. With that being said, had Emma Stone or Ellen Paige or Ryan Gosling been casted, this gets nominated for an Oscar or Golden Globe, no question. I guess that's just part of the politics of show business. Lame indeed.Regardless, this is one of the most enjoyable movies I've had the pleasure of watching, in a long time. It's that good and shouldn't be missed.Highly, highly recommended.
