These guys hit the mark with this one! I typically don't like movie renditions of books but they captured the essence of the book while creating gold on screen. The actors/actresses capture the most important elements and I would recommend all who enjoy a great drama to watch - you will not be disappointed! The producers and directors of the film deserve all the credit in the world for turning in a masterpiece. I have to say that this is one of my favorite films in the past decade - I could see it having tremendous success as time goes on. 10/10 Can't wait to re-watch and catch the moments that I missed the first time around!
