A very good movie: great acting, wonderful story line, and phenomenal message. A must see for everyone who enjoys movies with a purpose. This movie addresses some very pertinent subjects and does it in the most entertaining way. You can always tell when a film is good because the hour and a half that the movie played seemed to go by so quickly. And then there is the soundtrack: all original with some songs that I immediately went to iTunes to download. Be sure to download tracks 2, 4, 5, 7 @ 10: my personal favorites. We need more films like this, that don't mix real life messages with comedy and lessen the impact of what is being said. But don't take my word for it; by all means, view it for yourself. You won't be disappointed.
