First of all, I need to point out that horror movies are not my thing. I avoid them at all costs, but Conjoined doesn't take itself too seriously and that's the magic of this film. I actually enjoyed it, didn't find it too gross and found that for the most part it is laugh out loud funny! Horror fans will love it too - it really does have something for everyone. Conjoined has all the usual components of a good Joe Grisaffi film, like solid actors and a sound plot, and throws in unexpected elements that work really well for no discernible reason. Like, the Ricky Gervais style awkward pauses. They are uncomfortably realistic and bring an ounce or normality to a fantastical plot which adds necessary balance. Sara Gaston nails her role as the stern Detective.
