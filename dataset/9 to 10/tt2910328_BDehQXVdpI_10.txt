No Fire Zone: Sri Lanka Killing Fields truthfully exposes war crimes and crimes against humanity against the civilian population of the divided island. Having endured over 26 years of brutal civil war between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the Northern province has went from war-zone to virtual prison for the victims of the war. Channel 4 conducts a thorough investigation as to who the culprits were, and why they are hiding from an independent, international, investigation as to what exactly happened at the end of the ethnic conflict in 2009. View discretion is strongly advised.
