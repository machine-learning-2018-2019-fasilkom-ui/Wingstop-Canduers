This documentary has done an excellent job defying extreme efforts by the Sri Lanka government to suppress the truth from coming out. I know at times the producers have received death threats from the same Government. But with all this they had the courage to bring this film out.This film has triggered the international war crimes investigation against Sri Lanka by the UNHRC. Hopefully this film will also serve as evidence in the investigation and help bring the culprits in front of the Law and serve Justice to the victims of this indigestable truth. Although viewer discretion is advised, everyone who stands up for Human Rights must watch this Documentary.
