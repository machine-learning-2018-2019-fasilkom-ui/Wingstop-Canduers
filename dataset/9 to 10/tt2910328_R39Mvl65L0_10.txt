This film is a heartwrenching work about an often-forgotten conflict: Sri Lanka. It captivatingly portrays the horrific violence inflicted by the Sri Lankan government against Tamils on the island. War crimes and crimes against humanity that Sri Lanka is attempting to white-wash are uncovered through expert journalism.It is told from the perspective of victims, with analysis from international human rights experts. The historical context for Sri Lanka's decades of violence is also explored. It is a powerful, objective work of journalism and has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. I encourage the world to watch this film, and never forget.
