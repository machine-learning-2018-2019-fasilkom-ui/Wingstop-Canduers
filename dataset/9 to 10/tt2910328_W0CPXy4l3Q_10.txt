This is a well created documentary from videos taken during the spring of 2009. The sequencing of videos taken by different witnesses and the narration are excellent. The videos were taken by both the victims as well as Sri Lanka army personnel (trophy videos).Some have estimated the civilians deaths to be around 40,000. Other estimates are much higher. About 150,000 are unaccounted form, over 99% were civilians.Sri Lanka has questioned the validity of the videos. Chanel 4 has hence had all the photos and videos analyzed by independent experts, ruled unequivocally authentic. Sri Lanka is also resisting multiple calls for independent investigations.Some scenes are gory. Viewer discretion recommended.But it is must see for anyone interested in knowing the cruelty that occurred in a country that prides itself as 'Buddhist'!
