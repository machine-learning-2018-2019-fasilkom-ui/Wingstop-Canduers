This Authentic documentary depicts the war crimes and the genocide of one of the oldest ethnic national Tamils. It's an perfectly compiled evidence of War crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Sri Lankan army during Jan - May 2009 which includes inhuman activities like, brutal killings, rape, forced disappearances carried out by the srilankan army in the name of war.Srilanka is receiving condemnation from all over the world and from the leaders and countries which supported him in the war. This video shows just a glimpse of the massacre unleashed by the srilankan government headed by rajapakshe. Just because the govt. denies that there is no such killings committed by the army men, the truth cannot be buried.Many of the videos released by channel 4 are not shot by them but were made by the army men themselves using their mobile cameras. Channel 4 just paid to get the video or the army person was guilty of his act. If the srilankan govt alleges that they are fake, then they should technically prove that they were not real and can file a petition against channel 4. I urge all the people in the wold who has a bit of humanity in heart to just view this once and make your own judgment about whether it is fake or not. We thank Channel 4 of this video inspite of all hinderences from the SriLankan regime
