This is a film that pulls no punches. Watching these innocent people killed in the cover of "Killing the terrorists" is haunting and horrifying because it is based on events that actually happen. These people trying to stay alive from day to day is a sobering viewing experience. Glad that CH4 was able to bring this atrocities committed by this cowardly regime to light. Hope these voiceless people will get justice someday.Some of the young men and women were blind folded, hands tied and then executed. These are inhuman instincts.People are killed anywhere and everywhere without respite and their corpses abandoned without proper burial or funeral. Singala army's motto when it comes to human life - "Kill'em all"
