I cannot believe it! It was simply fantastic. I guess I need to say "AWESOME"! Jay Milnamow &amp; Gerald Yelverton, writers and Producers along with the fantastic Director Olga Nechaeva of N-meN Production brought us such a funny and flowing Comedy with an actual story. I have so much to say, I cannot put my words together. The Premier Showing started out with a short narration of the story and a story it was! Funny, interesting, and spell bounding in actually seeing some people I actually knew but they were whatever characters Jay and Gerald &amp; Olga made them. Not once did I look at the screen and think I knew the people I didn't make that association. The Actors &amp; Actresses played their parts so real and were perfect for every scene. I loved this Movie, it was and is AWESOME and I am sure it will be seen by the rest of the World. This Movie should be an instant money maker and is the best Comedy that I have seen in years. I am just hoping the right people pick up on this movie, no one will be disappointed. The Crowd was overcome with laughter. A Comedy with a Real Plot and Professionally Made. Everyone needs to be given a fair chance to see this movie at their Theatres. It is just AWESOME, "AWESOME Movie" by the HIGHLY SOBER PRODUCTIONS, Jay Milnamow &amp; Gerald both of Delaware and N-meN Productions, OLGA NECHAEVA from Queens NYC.. Cast was fantastic and needs this to be an A+ on their Resume. Please call someone and ask for "AWESOME Movie"..........Fantastic!
