Watched this last night on iTunes, and didn't really expect much. Lance Henriksen was the only actor I recognized at first, but I found out later that the crazy neighbor was Bruce's girlfriend in the original Evil Dead, that was cool. Anyway, Lake Eerie was actually pretty good. Maybe it was because I had low expectations going in. Great camera work, i'm so sick of the "shaky cam" nonsense in low budget movies. I get that it is easier and cheaper, but it looks terrible.I'm surprised by the really low rating and negative reviews here though. I don't think those people watch many low budget independents films, because I do, and this was definitely one of the better ones.8-9 out of 10 for what it is. Remember, you don't review it the same as you would a studio film. Silly kids.
