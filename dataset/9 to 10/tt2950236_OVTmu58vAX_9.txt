I saw this movie at a screening in Boston MA sponsored by Emerson college. I was impressed with the content of the film and how Jack Bryan the writer/director incorporates his characters and intertwines their lives into the dark depths of alcoholism and domestic violence. His choice of cast members was right on and I particularly liked his portrayal of the killer played by Chris Mulkey. I was surprised by the ending but not disappointed. This is a must see movie. I hope to have the opportunity to experience more works from this group of talented writers, directors, and producers along with all members who made this film what it is.
