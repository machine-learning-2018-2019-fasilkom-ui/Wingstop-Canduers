Kenny Wormald as Gordon carries this movie from start to finish. He shines in his role as the confused, spirit broken, son of Angella, brother of Molly, and trapped future-less stock clerk at a local grocery store.Gordon feels defeated by his mother constantly pecking at him and belittling him. Gordon wants to stand up to his abusive brother-in-law but lacks the will and the drive. His mother fails to realize she has destroyed her son. Molly (his sister) and wife to Teddy only stands up for herself when pushed into a corner as shown by how her husband Teddy beat her and then Molly fights back. But she cannot stay away from Teddy at her mother's house because she see's her mother as more abusive psychologically than Teddy's physical abuse.Fran Kranz as the husband Teddy is very smooth and likable in this role as he charmingly worms his way back into Molly's trust only to have Molly reject him again and again. BUT pay attention to the kitchen scene near the end of the movie! His true character is coming out when he gets Molly to 'get' something for him. And she does! She is now back into his control.Chris Mulkey as Howard is one spooky dude! A terrible creature and Gordon doesn't realize this until it's too late and he then knows he's in over his head. Howard has complete control of him. The finest scene is in the restaurant conversation between Howard and Gordon .... it is here that Gordon actually gets Howard to philosophically question himself and his life. But he too is in over his head with his past life and he cannot escape it, his ship is sinking and he might as well go down with it. On the other hand Gordon must find a way off this sinking ship.This film is perfect from start to finish! Bravo's to writer/director Jack Bryan and the entire cast. A must see film!
