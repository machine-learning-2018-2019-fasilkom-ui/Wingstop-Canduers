This movie is a superb combination of thriller and socially conscious film-making. I've never really seen a film that is as good. The acting is great all around. The characters are nuanced. The problem of domestic violence is subtly depicted. The courage of the filmmakers is obvious from the start. I highly recommend this film. My one reservation concerns the depiction of the killer as southern. But the portrayal of people wiling to forgive is truly amazing and impressive. So, I agree totally with this other review: I saw this movie at a screening in Boston MA sponsored by Emerson college. I was impressed with the content of the film and how Jack Bryan the writer/director incorporates his characters and intertwines their lives into the dark depths of alcoholism and domestic violence. His choice of cast members was right on and I particularly liked his portrayal of the killer played by Chris Mulkey. I was surprised by the ending but not disappointed. This is a must see movie. I hope to have the opportunity to experience more works from this group of talented writers, directors, and producers along with all members who made this film what it is.
