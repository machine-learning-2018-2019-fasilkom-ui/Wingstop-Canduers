I saw this film at the Tallgrass Film Festival, and it was excellent.  Jack Bryan really knows how to write a compelling tale, and the film  ends in a way that Hollywood could never deliver. There's a  well-established sense of the world that the characters inhabit, and it  never feels like a low-budget production.  There are several long dialog takes that are thoroughly impressive  performances. It's good to see Fran Kranz in a serious role, as he  totally sells the character. Hopefully this acts as a showcase for more  dramatic projects. I was unfamiliar with Jocelin Donahue, but will  definitely keep an eye out for her in other films. Chris Mulkey is a  beast, and absolutely kills it.   The people involved in making this movie are clearly talented and  passionate individuals, and I can't wait to see what they bring to the  table next.
