It actually wasn't as bad as I thought. It's a good family movie and had a much better plot than Chipwrecked. I do advise you to watch the first and second one before this one, so you know what's going on and who the characters are. They could've left out the "potty" humor, but there wasn't much. I liked it a lot and it's definitely aimed at kids. It's not a must-see, if you want to an Alvin and the Chipmunks movie, I'd suggest watching the Chipmunk Adventure, Meet the Wolfman, or the first one in 2007, but if you want to entertain your kids for an hour and a half at a movie theater then knock your socks off. Overall cute storyline with a talented cast and moments that will make your child and maybe even yourself laugh.
