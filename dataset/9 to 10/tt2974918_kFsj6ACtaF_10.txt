This was a wonderful fun film with fantastic music and a great family friendly message. There were great actors in it like Tony hale, (and of course Jason lee) but also great cameos. My kids were dancing for half the movie. Seemed smarter and heart warming than most. We loved it! I would recommend to anyone, even people not familiar with the franchise as it seemed to play great for kids and also the adults! It plays like a musical with pretty incredible dance sequences. And the music seemed hipper than usual. Kids are already asking to see it again, so will probably go back before new years. We also loved the message about blended families in it, the ending is really sweet, and makes you feel great when you come out of the theater.
