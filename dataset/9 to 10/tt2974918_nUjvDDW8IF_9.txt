When people write that they hate this movie and that it's awful, they seem to forget what this movie tries to do. It's a fun kids movie. I just watched all the now four movies with the chipmunks and I liked each one of them. This franchise has unlimited potential, lovely characters and an original idea. Love the cameos by real stars and their remakes of popular songs. This movie has a bit of a weak plot. They didn't really go on a road trip, they visited a bar in Texas and the rest of their stops we only saw through a short montage with them singing to get money for public transport. but in a kids movie, who cares!? I enjoyed it so much! The song that they sing in the end is so great! Cried man tears ;)
