I can not believe how this great family movie is so underrated despite the fact it is a terrific movie.Me and my dear son Muhammad enjoyed watching this perfect family movie from the beginning to the end. The low ratings does not clearly prove that the film is bad.Also,the negative comments by movie critics and IMDb critics don't necessarily mean that this movie is bad at all.It is important to tell you that this film: "Alvin and The Chipmunks:The Road Chip" is currently achieving enormous international success at the movie box office. In the USA,it is a new entry at number 2 and elsewhere,it is number 1.(This is a very good evidence that despite the low rating,the movie is successful ).Finally,I advise every person whether an adult or a child who want a fantastic comedy/adventure movie is to see this movie and you will be quite happy.
