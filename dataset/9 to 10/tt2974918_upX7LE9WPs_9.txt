Alvin and the Chipmunks The Road Chip is a great family film! It's hilarious, good writing, cute, and well, their chipmunks that can talk (and the Chipettes too!) There's a little something for everybody in this one. A great plot with action, adventure and romance. Great music lots of car scenes and one unlikely character who must just end up being related to the furry trio. It also teaches a good lesson about family and trust. The kids will certainly enjoy Alvin and his brothers in this crazy adventure cross country. Outstanding film full of action, love, laughter, and remarkable characters (You) and your kids will love! Enjoy!
