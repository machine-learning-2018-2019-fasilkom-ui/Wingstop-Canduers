While technically a documentary, this film about Rich's life has more of a homey fireside chat feel to it. As David Leo Schulz interviews those who knew Rich from the beginning of his life until the end, one gets a broad picture of his life that does not disappoint. For those who have seen other materials about Rich's life, this one will be an eye-opener in that it introduces us to some lesser-heard-from individuals in Rich's life (such as his brother Lloyd, who comes across more as a down-to-earth Hoosier country boy than as the brother of a Christian musician). The only disappointment was that the only extended interview material on the DVD had material only from the interview with Brennan Manning and from the interview with Mac Powell of Third Day; I was hoping to see more extended interview material from Mitch McVicker. The film also does not explore in great detail Rich's interest in Catholicism (which, I suppose, is somewhat understandable, as most of his friends, family, and even the documentary producer are Protestants). Perhaps most poignant are the segments at the end in which friends and family members describe how they each dealt with the news of Rich's death. This is a must-see companion to Ragamuffin (2014), the feature film based on Rich's life.
