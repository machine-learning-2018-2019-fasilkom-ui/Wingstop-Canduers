What a great movie. Made on a $500,000 budget, and possibly the best, most honest movie I have ever seen. Too many Christians have confused religion with the gospel of Jesus Christ. They have equated morality and ethics with Christianity. The Bible makes a huge distinction between the irreligious, the religious, and Christianity. Jesus goes to great lengths throughout his time on earth to urge people towards authenticity... Towards admitting that we are all sinners and pushing us deeper into the gospel. Into grace. Into true healing that comes through His righteousness and not our own. This movie is a great example of Jesus' unrelenting love and pursuit of a ragamuffin like Rich, and it shows that God uses surrendered hearts that are Vulnerable and dependent. in touch with Jesus, much more than perfect religious people who rely on religion and their own righteous acts.Great movie.
