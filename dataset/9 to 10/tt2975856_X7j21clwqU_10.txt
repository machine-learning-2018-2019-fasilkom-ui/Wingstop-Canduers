This movie is EXCELLENT and PROFUND! It is a thought provoking story that touched my heart deeply. There are may aspect of his life that I can relate to. Rich experienced similar challenges that which I have seen in the lives of myself and others. His faith perseveres throughout his struggles. He was not afraid to share his beliefs of his relationship with God and what he felt that God expects of us. His beliefs were so strong that he was not afraid to offend traditional Chrisitan standards. It is definitely worth attending at a theater. OR if you can bring the movie to your church. My only regret is it not available to view at the theater or on DVD. Rich Mullins was a wonderful artist. I love his music and miss him greatly!
