I had the great pleasure of watching the premier last night at the Scare-a-Con at the Turning Stone Casino in New York.The film was an absolute hoot, and had the audience laughing and gasping at the same time. The horror icons (too many to list - see the cast list) did their jobs admirably and with perfect execution. The camera work and post-production work was very well done. My only concern was the non-linear time line jumps, but as John Schneider pointed out in the subsequent Q&amp;A session, it keeps one focused on the film, but in the same breath he assured us that a completely linear version will be on the DVD when it is released.In short, I'm probably going straight to Hell for laughing at a lot of this stuff, but I guess I'll see you all there. You'll know me, I'll be the guy in the trench coat black-marketing ice cubes!RR
