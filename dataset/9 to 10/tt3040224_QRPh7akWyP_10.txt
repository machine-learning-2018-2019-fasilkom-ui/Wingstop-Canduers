I really enjoyed this, I don't usually get to see this much Bill and Kane in a movie! Yeah, it is kinda cheesy, but that is what I loved about it! I laughed at several parts and I thought everyone did a great job. I think this is great for those that love all these horror icons, R.A's secret cracked me up, lol. I am not going to give spoilers, why read a movie review for the spoilers!? Instead, I will say this is great for what it is, and I could tell everyone had a great time making the movie, that is what counts! We all know that no one in this just did it for the money, they did it because they love what they do! This is a fun movie and I will be watching this again!! Great job!!!
