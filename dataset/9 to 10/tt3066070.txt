The Astor Barber All-Stars is a fascinating look at a cultural phenomenon, a barbershop filled with history and characters out of a reality sit-com. Nothing contrived or gimmicky about this. The filmmaker, Karen Gehres, gives a brilliant portrait of a professional subculture that is poignant, revealing and very funny. There are subjects who work in the barbershop. There are customers whose parents used to patronize the shop. There are traditions &amp; practices in the art of hair-cutting that have changed with the times and many that have been sustained at this remarkable place for decades. Well worth watching.
