The story line is NOT predictable which makes this movie such a treat to watch. As a viewer you are completely invested throughout, experiencing a variety of emotions. "Abby is a very talented young actress who was a perfect casting choice for this role. The scenery was so unique and beautiful in some parts of the movie, it took my breath away. The make up was very realistic, so much so in one scene I found myself wondering just what was used to get that effect. I have viewed other films by this Director and I have not been disappointed in anything he has directed, even though his range is diverse. I will be watching and waiting to see if this movie gains entry into the New Orleans Film Festival. This is a sure winner and absolutely a must see to put on your list.
