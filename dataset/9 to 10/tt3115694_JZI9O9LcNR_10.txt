Overall the movie had awesome production values and a cool main cast. The two leads click throughout in a movie that's good enough to engender curiosity. The theme was a uncommonly smart and insightful way to look at relationships while delivering the requisite torment and romantic heat.If you're tired of the predictable plots of romantics like me, check out this unconventional romantic movie. In most romantic movies, the obstacles men and women face are usually just misunderstandings and personalities that seem incompatible at first. However, couples in unconventional romantic movies, like this, have to deal with all sorts of crazy problems. Definitely worth a watch.
