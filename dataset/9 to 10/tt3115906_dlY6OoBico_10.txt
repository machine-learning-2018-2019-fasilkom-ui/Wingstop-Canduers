I watched this movie last night on Amazon and was taken into this world that was so close to reality that it was uncomfortable at times. I felt like a fly on the wall of this girl's life. There seemed to be no separation between what was fiction and reality and that's what I loved the most. It felt almost like a documentary in certain parts. Some people might be taken aback by the graphic nature, but that's real life and I should know as I worked in that business for half of my life which is what drew me to the film in the first place. People need to realize and understand that the sex industry is not pretty and it's not nice and if you're offended by the truth, then perhaps you should watch a Disney movie next time. It upset me in certain ways because it brought back some upsetting memories for myself, but comforting at the same time because I know that I'm not alone in my experiences. Girl Lost is disturbingly beautiful and very well filmed and fantastic acting. 10 stars from me. I wish there were more films to watch like this.
