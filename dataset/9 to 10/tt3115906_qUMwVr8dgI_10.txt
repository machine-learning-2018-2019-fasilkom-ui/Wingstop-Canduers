I always say that the sign of a great independent film that is original and challenges the viewer is the number of 1/10 star reviews and 10/10 reviews. It's a direct indication that the viewers who rated 1/10 stars really weren't willing to watch with an open heart and an open mind. Without getting into the details of the story, you can read the synopsis or watch the trailer, Girl Lost is a rare piece of filmmaking. It's beautifully written, tragic in thought, pure in it's own way. I hope that people will continue to watch and fall in love with it as I did. By the end of movie the tears were streaming down my face. What a gem!
