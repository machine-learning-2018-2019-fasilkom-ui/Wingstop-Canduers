I really didn't know what to expect but I was moved watching this movie while being captivated by the hauntingly beautiful music. If there's one gripe I've had with some independent films, it's the poor choice of scoring music. This film however, has music that compliments it perfectly. Although relatively easy to predict the ending, it did not take away from the overall impact of this great film which outshines anything "hardlywood" has done in decades. It pulls you in and doesn't let go. As real as it gets...
