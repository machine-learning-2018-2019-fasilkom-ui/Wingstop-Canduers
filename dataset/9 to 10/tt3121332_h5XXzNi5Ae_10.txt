I watched it as I saw Kristen Wiig was in it. I knew if she chose to be part of an independent film than it was going to be worth watching. The depth and imperfections in each character were beautiful. There is no doubt that everyone who performed in this movie believed in it and did it for the art and beauty of a great film. I am unfamiliar with most of the other actors in the film but I loved them all. I will keep an eye out for more of these passion projects as they are worth the time to see. There was nothing Hollywood about this movie. Nothing looked like set, wardrobe or hair and make up. It truly looked like I was part of the lives of the characters, which I do not often find. Everyone who took part in this film should be very proud as it's a great work of art.
