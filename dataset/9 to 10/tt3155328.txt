Netflix said I will give this a full score. Netflix was right. This is a film about a man who has no job and no prospects. He thinks he is a good gambler but he is not good at all. A friend/colleague is going to prison. The guy leaves the protagonist a bag and says in clear terms, don't open it. I'll take it back when I get out and give you $10k. Our protagonist agrees. But he can't help him self.What follows is a funny, entertaining and hilarious ride. I loved this. This is like an Indie Swingers. This is Jake Johnson's best film since drinking buddies which I really liked. Raw and edgy. Fans of Rounders + Swingers + Owning Mahowny may appreciate it. Whereas Louis Ck fans might wanna try it too. Why am I writing this review? The rating on IMDb is ridiculous and discouraging
