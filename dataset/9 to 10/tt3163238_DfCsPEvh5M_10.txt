I was one of the fortunate ones who had the privileged of watching the world premiere of this film at the Hawaii Theatre. It was night none of us will ever forget, starting with a beautiful love song from the film by Kealli Reichel, a hula by Kumu Hina herself, and then the film.And what a film it is. Fast paced yet stately, intimate yet unflinching in its brutal honesty. You see Hina is a teacher and a cultural landmark in Hawaii, but she also just happens to be mahu, or what the rest of the world labels as transgender. But in Hina's case its not her "sex" that is different it is her spirit. Yes, she has both male and female personality, but that is exactly what makes her so powerful.As she teaches the keiki, runs the burial council, and deals with a young husband, we ultimately understand that she is like every person - only stronger!It ws an honor to see this film.
