This is the best documentary I've seen this year.Although it's likely to be classified as a "transgender film," because the namesake character is mahu, it's really about the universal power of culture to empower youth. And although Kumu Hina is the protagonist, the character who steals is the show is her young student. She is the very manifestation of "girl- power," and it's a joy to see her bloom under Kumu's care.I know it's a cliché, but this film really did make me laugh and cry - and more. What a fascinating film for adults, but children could also benefit. It's really impossible to put this film into a particular niche. It's a message that crosses all boundaries.
