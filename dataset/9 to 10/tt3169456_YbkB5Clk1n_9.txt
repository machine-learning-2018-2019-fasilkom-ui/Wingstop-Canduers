The '80s soundtrack and suburban setting took me back to the John Hughes movies I grew up with. But the darker story lines (no spoilers, but suffice it to say there's death, sex, drugs and a mental hospital) and the grittiness of the Queens/Long Island setting add an extra layer of surprise, edge and delight. I was really moved. Fun movie!
