You don't need to be a fan of stock car racing to appreciate "The Last Race," a beautiful portrait of a vanishing piece of Americana.The film examines a small-town race track, the blue-collar players that inhabit it and the close-knit community that revolves around it. Throughout the film it's impossible to stay apathetic to the sight of local heroes (race car drivers), the elderly track owners and the characters that frequent the race track who might lose their beloved track to real-estate development greed.The film is loaded with life-or-death stakes (even thought the film couldn't be further away from NASCAR's world), intimate camerawork and impressive sound design. Director Michael Dweck uses long takes and little talk, and lets the environment and visuals do all the explaining.Dweck found beauty in an unusual place and has shared it with all who care to look at it.
