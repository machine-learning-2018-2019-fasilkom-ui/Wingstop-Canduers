In the film, Dan Eldon references that there are alternative ways to get an education. Let's start that initiative by playing this film in all high school history classes across the world. Not only is there a history lesson here about the civil war that was happening in Somalia in 1993, there are lessons on passion, foreign policy, and the power of media to name a few. Watching this film in 2018 I couldn't help but see striking parallels in our society today. In the film, the UN forces are fighting enemies of hunger, disease, corruption and apartheid. In the United States alone we continue to fight racial injustice, the leading cause of death is heart disease, and although hunger isn't our problem, obesity is. The greatest lesson of all in the film is Dan's belief that people are not born hating other people. Rather, that trait is stemmed from the conditions of their environment and it is forced on them when their ignorance runs out. Also that the media has the power to change the way you think and impact political action. While this is an amazing power, it also is a good reminder, especially for youth, that the media has biases and it is important to know how to sort through quality news sources. All in all, an inspiring and eye-opening story that needs to be shared.
