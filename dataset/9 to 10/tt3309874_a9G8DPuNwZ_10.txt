Eleven Eleven is a quirky, fun movie which transcends its budgetary limitations and is a mercifully good-natured tale of being true to yourself and following your muse, inspiration or harmless delusion, whatever the case may be. Of course, in Charles Baker's case (as Tim), delusion turns out to be reality, and it just serves to bind his family even tighter together.Of course, adultery with an extraterrestrial immediately brings to mind the charge of "alienation of affection" that might go along with otherworldly infatuation, but so be it. Krista Allen is delightful as the naughty alien female, Andromeda, and Jennifer Pfalzgraff brings a well-grounded and even sympathetic performance as Eve, Tim's bible-thumping wife, who, in a less capable actor's hands, might have come off as just campy and off-putting.The special effects are serviceable given the low budget nature of the film, but there is something to be said for a film that makes up for its flash and visual pizzazz with a warm hearted and genuinely funny story. Shot in Arizona, the natural landscape is integral to the story and becomes a character in its own right.
Just one word of advice... if your closet is full of red shirts, you're just flirtin' with disaster.
