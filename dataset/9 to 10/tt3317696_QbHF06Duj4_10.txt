This movie reminds us of how lucky we are to be alive and free. If one can only comprehend the hardship of losing your family and your freedom, which is exactly what they went through in real life. I can't even imagine going through anything like this. Watching this documentary makes me appreciate life and all the little things. I highly recommend sharing this story and using it as an educational tool to reach the new generation.
