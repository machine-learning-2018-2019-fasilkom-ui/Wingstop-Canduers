Over the past 3-4 years I've viewed multiple WWII documentaries and movies and read as many books, most of them involving the Holocaust. There are stories of romance, daring escapes, suspense, brutality, unbelievable survival, jaw-dropping heroism, heartbreaking loss and miraculous reunions. This docudrama has it all. It would be more of an honor to meet Max Fronenberg, a man of incredible noble character, than any world leader. It was an honor even just to see this, to have a glimpse into his life. Unless made of stone, his story will motivate, inspire and challenge any viewer to live better, be better. I want my entire family and all of my friends to see this. I give this film a 10+ rating.
