I really loved this remake of the Colin Thiele classic. The film is moody, atmospheric and absolutely lovely to look at. The indigenous content is sympathetic and well done.
Geoffrey Rush has never been better in my opinion and the young boy and the pelicans are nothing short of wonderful to watch.
South Australia's Coorong looks just beautiful.
I'm no critic, but I loved this film.
