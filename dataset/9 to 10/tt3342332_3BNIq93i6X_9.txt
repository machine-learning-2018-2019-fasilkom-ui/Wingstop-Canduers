I really enjoyed this film. Its hard to describe it without giving some of the twists away. There is a lot of twists. You think the film is simply about a black guy saving an innocent white girl from her sexually abusive father. However it turns out to be very different from what things appear. Then it turns out to be completely different from that. Despite this the film is easy to follow and the twists are genuinely surprising. The interracial part of the story seemed to be put in as an after thought. The racism of 1950s Southern USA is touched upon but I am pretty sure the couple would have had more trouble from people than the little they did. This has really good acting. The main and support cast are believable. The ending is poetic justice. It is a really enjoyable film.
