No Way to Live is a thrilling and memorable film experience.I rented this film on Amazon because I liked the title. It turned out to be a superbly made suspenseful period noir filled with plenty of twists and turns you'll never see coming.It's visual flair hearkens back to the classic Douglus Sirk Melodramas of the 50's but the film manages to take what was once old and make it new and fresh again.The soundtrack flips between period 50's rock and a haunting orchestral score that will keep you engaged and on the edge of your seat.But the heart of this film are the electrifying performances by Freya Tingley and Tom Williamson, who play an interracial couple on the run in the segregated American South.Their on screen chemistry is as good as it gets and It was refreshing to see such fleshed out characterization that is all too often missing in today's modern film world.I'll be looking forward to revisiting this film many times in the years to come.10/10
