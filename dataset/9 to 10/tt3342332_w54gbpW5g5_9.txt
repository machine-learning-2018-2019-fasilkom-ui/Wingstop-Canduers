No Way To Live is a rare find. It's a Noir in the tradition of the the genre's literary innovators -- that in turn shaped the genre's golden age in film. Few modern thrillers take notes from these masters. There are obvious shades of James Cain's "Postman Always Rings Twice", Jim Thompson's "Hell of a Woman", and even Robert Edmond Alter's "Swamp Sister".The film will keep you in relentless suspense, trying to guess the next move, as twists and turns abound (but, importantly, it never neglects having a healthy sense of humor). And Freya Tingley delivers a knockout performance as Nora Thompson. A major star-turn.I watched this at a festival, and looking forward to listen to the commentary on the Blu-Ray release. Highly recommend!
