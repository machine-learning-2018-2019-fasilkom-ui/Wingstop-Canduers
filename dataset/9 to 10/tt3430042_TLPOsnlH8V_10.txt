In an age of storytelling dominated (but not entirely representative) by big effects and/or high budgets masking an often bland and rhetorical script, it is great to find a gem that weaves an interesting and compelling story and bread &amp; butter realism of characters. The Phoenix Project I include among other small intimate compelling films such as The Man From Earth. This film doesn't dumb down to find a bigger audience and it doesn't feel like I need a degree in anything to understand exactly what is going on; it treats one as an intelligent viewer. What is different about The Phoenix Project from other similar features is that this film relies on our characters to take us through this journey, not on the audiences ability to "see the whole picture." The premise is tried and true, yes. Have we seen a bunch of scientists young or old attempting similar experimentation? Yes. But this path is not one often seen; the struggle of those who have thrust themselves headlong into a creative/scientific process mentally, emotionally, morally, ethically. In truth, the brilliance of "The Project" is in the questions it poses to it's characters about where they live in relation to "the line." It's the same questions posed to us as viewers, as the film moves us through "the shoes" of our four characters. The views, thoughts, doubts and plans are all those we too would find ourselves facing in the moments of "The Project." Regardless of where you fall in relation to which character you feel represents yourself, the end result is the same; a slow taught movie not interested in asking if you COULD, but if you WOULD.
