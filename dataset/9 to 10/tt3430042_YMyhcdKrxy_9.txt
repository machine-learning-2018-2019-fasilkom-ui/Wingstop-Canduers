I honestly can not believe so many were disappointed with this film. I thought it was well written and well acted. I am a science geek so maybe that is why I enjoyed it more than most. It did move slowly, but that is the type of film it was meant to be. It was more about getting to know and staying attached to the characters.I loved the fact that they had moral issues with the experiment and were not afraid to voice that. There can be a very fine line between Science and Moral issues and they a good job depicting those emotions..I thought it was a very powerful, emotional moving film.I agree with the others about the end. I sure wish it would have ended on a better note..
