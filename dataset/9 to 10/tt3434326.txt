I decided to write a review on a local film I just watched called Lone Rivers. A very compelling story of family, struggles and love. They touched on so much I can't add much more for fear of spoiling. This film defiantly hits every emotion! The music composition was right on track too. It was so enjoyable to see all the local spots they filmed. All the outside scenes were so nice, I loved seeing our Michigan sunsets as well, oh I hope that isn't a spoiler. Everyone who worked on the film did a great job! Looking forward to seeing any future projects from this group. Everyone is very talented. I will be encourages others to go and see this film.
