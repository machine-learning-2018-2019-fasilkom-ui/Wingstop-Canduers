I'm a big fan of the band Liars, so I checked out this movie. The music, in combination with the visuals, really took me into the character's mind. I think you'd call it a coming-of-age story. But it's different. The filmmaking almost seems like it "grows up" along with the girl or something, if that makes sense. I probably need to see it again to understand everything. Definitely not for everyone but strangely compelling.
