Listing all of the reasons to check out the indie drama would take longer than if you just trust me, and go watch it. Spend the time you would have used reading this to discuss the film afterwards, because you are going to want to talk about it. The sights, sounds, and performances from 1/1 will flash into your consciousness for weeks to come. Stop reading this, gather your most interesting friends, turn out the lights, crank up the speakers, and enjoy 1/1.This film is so finely layered that it's complexity seems effortless and natural. Each element on its own would be reason enough to check out this movie. The cinematography is so beautiful that I could happily watch this flick on Mute. The soundtrack is absolutely worth purchasing and listening to on its own. The performances are so solid that you could watch 1/1 as a play. The editing is tight with a tense pace. The script has such a light and subtle touch, you'll swear it was adapted from a poem, or maybe a song. Everyone involved in this movie needs to work more. How can you watch 1/1 and NOT want to cast Lindsey Shaw in EVERY movie? Hollywood, put her in more movies! And Judd Nelson steps up to the plate and reminds us why he is a household name. Judd turns out a very powerful, tortured performance. The director, the cinematographer, everyone here has a bright future, and I cannot wait to see what they make next.
