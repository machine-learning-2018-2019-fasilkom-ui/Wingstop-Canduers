Constructed the way a brain might actually process conflict, trauma, and transition, this film seethes with the dark side of emotion, allowing the viewer to become embroiled in each character's turmoil. The experience is effectively uncomfortable, an ultimately triumphant effort providing insight to perspective outside of one's own while bridging that gap with the familiarity of both feeling stuck and being jarred. Family rifts, mental illness, and the search to understand and accept oneself are intertwined through visual and aural art style unique to the filmmakers, breaking new ground. It is like nothing I've ever seen, and I hope to see much more from this team.
