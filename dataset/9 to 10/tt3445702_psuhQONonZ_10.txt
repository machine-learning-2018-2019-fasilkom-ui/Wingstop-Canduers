I love this little film. It's one anyone can identify sign. Either you've been there or you know someone who has. The performances were spot on, but my favorite part is a scene between Lissa (Lindsey Shaw) &amp; Joan (Dendrie Taylor) that struck a nerve. Their performances were so good you get sucked into it. Love it!
