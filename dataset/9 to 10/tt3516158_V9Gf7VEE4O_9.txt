The atmosphere and themes in A Few Cubic Meters Of Love might not be the most cohesive, but they're all so beautifully realized across both of the stories it tells. The simple sense of romantic longing and isolated sadness permeates the air, as instinct takes over to bind the individuals and their recurring need for something more. It prioritizes mood and feeling over narrative structure, while still retaining a naturalistic sense of being. The ending packs a particular punch in the gut, raising the level of the film considerably.
