Between the Frames - The Art of Brazilian Animation a.k.a. Luz Anima Ação is an excellent educational film production that offers a thorough picture of the history of animation in Brazil, using interviews with various animators, artists, film historians and rare film clips. I found it an enlightening document, one that I highly recommend to film schools internationally. Of particular interest to me is the examination of small independent studios and artists who explored a diversity of individualistic styles and techniques, e.g., Roberto Miller, Chico Liberato, Otto Guerra, and Marcos Magalhaes, among many others. The clever thread throughout the film of current animators -- re-creating the lost earliest Brazilian 1917 animated film "Kaiser" by "Seth" (Alvaro Marins) -- is a fine idea, emotionally connecting the past with the present. -John Canemaker
