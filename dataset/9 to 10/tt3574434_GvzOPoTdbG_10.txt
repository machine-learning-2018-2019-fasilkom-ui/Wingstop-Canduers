I personally think this movie was GREAT!! I mean the dances and singing were great. I think that it really does give you a glimpse of an Indian Movie in a Peruvian Style way. I was very excited to see it and it was worth it. I have never seem a Peruvial musical in a MOTION PICTURE, YES am talking about a REAL MOVIE, am not talking about DOCUMENTALS, TV SHOWS, OR CONTEST. The locations were very beautiful, the actors bring a living body, very colorful.The marinera dancing is one of the major highlights of the movie. The first half is a complete entertainer with some great funny instances. The movie was smooth as a poem which leaves you with some memorable thoughts of your infancy.Another noticeable aspect of the movie is the performance by Oscar Aviles and those strong words that will be stay forever in your heart. Congratulations
