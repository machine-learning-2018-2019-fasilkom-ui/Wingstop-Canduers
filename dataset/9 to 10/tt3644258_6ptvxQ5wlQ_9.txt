My aunt and me decided to get this movie on iTunes because it sounded fun. She has been going through a hard time and wanted to just chill out and relax. I don't think we were expected to be so entertained by such a sweet movie. I don't usually write reviews but I see A LOT of movies and this one really hits the spot. It was funny but also had great heart. The guy who plays the lead is very handsome and I totally believed him in both roles. There are a TON of supporting characters you WILL recognize from other movies and TV shows. Hal Linden from Barney Miller is in it and what a treat it is to see him. My aunt said she had a major crush on him back in the day. The lead girl is good in the movie but something about her makes her seem stuck up. I don't know, maybe she was just acting. I would totally recommend this movie to anyone who was looking for something fun and entertaining. We both really enjoyed it.
