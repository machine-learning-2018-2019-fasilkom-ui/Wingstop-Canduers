Saw the trailer to the film and took a chance based a few of the cast members I like from TV. Funny and entertaining the whole way. I like the look of the film and the"realness" of the dialogue and acting. Definitely a Get Shorty kind of thing but also has a love story which worked for me. Good to see Hal Linden again as well as Kevin Chapman, who I've liked since he was on The Brotherhood. Not familiar with the lead actor but it kind of worked for the story as he is supposed to be a nobody. The story really surprised me along the way and the two hit men add a needed laugh at the right moments. All of the character parts were good in the movie, which is something that I like. Not exactly a mob movie, not a romantic comedy but somewhere in between. Would definitely recommend.
