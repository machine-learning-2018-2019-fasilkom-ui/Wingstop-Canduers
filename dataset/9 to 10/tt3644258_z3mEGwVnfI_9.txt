Who or what is for real? This movie is, and in so many ways. It's a sharp satire on the mob. It's a wry commentary on the acting life. It's a witty dig at the LA lifestyle (the west part at least). It's a sweet, comic commentary on love and family. And it's a classic mistaken-identity farce. Watch it, and watch it over again. You'll get more out of it each time.
