I first found out about this project several years ago, even before Milo put out a call to help Cassie get funding. It's been a long, almost agonizing wait, but boy was it worth it.Cassie Jaye is an excellent documentarian. She gives both sides a chance to make their case and doesn't interfere. She does, however, keep a video diary of her experience making the film, and watching her journey and evolution through a series of diary entries is just as compelling as anything else in the movie. It was a good decision to do this.Her cameras capture moments of every hue and shade, from maddening and frustrating to deeply touching. Very compelling stuff.If I had to pick a favorite moment, I would be torn between two. Karen Straughan at around the 1:41:00 mark, where with exquisite timing and razor sharp logic she delivers a coup de grace like only she can. It's the summary of a video she did a few years back, and her point is just as compelling now as then.The other candidate would be the very last line of the movie, delivered by Cassie Jaye herself.Thank you, Cassie, for having an open mind and dealing with some cognitive dissonance. I think men all over the Western world are going to owe you a debt of gratitude. This means a lot, and the documentary was fully as superb and entertaining as it deserved to be. God bless.
