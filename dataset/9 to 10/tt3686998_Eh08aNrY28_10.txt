I saw The Red Pill last night in Berkeley, Calif and loved it. Cassie Jaye masterfully shows what I and many others have seen and experienced while advocating for men.When I first found the men's movement, I used to argue with MRAs about feminism, naively thinking it stood for equality. Then I saw the truth play out right in front of me. After I testified in favor of a California shared parenting bill, I watched a rep from NOW and a rep from the domestic violence industry misrepresent the truth and lie under oath about fathers, children and abuse. They killed the bill, even though 85% of the population supports shared parenting. That was my red pill moment. The MRAs had been been telling me the truth. Feminists oppose equality, when it removes unfair control women have. Then I watched several videos of shared parenting bills in other states being killed (always by someone from NOW and someone from the DV industry) with the same misinformation and lies.The film brought tears to my eyes more than once. As a shared parenting advocate, I can attest to the mass heartbreak and suffering of fathers unfairly separated from their children. I'm very glad Cassie addressed domestic violence by women. Advocates for male victims of domestic violence once convinced Whoopi Goldberg to ask Vice President Biden to speak on the subject of female perpetrators of domestic violence, during The View TV show. Instead, he threw his hands up in the air and lied, saying every man in prison watched their father beat their mother. The misinformation that Cassie is exposing runs very deep, and is connected to power, control, and money. From the bottom of my heart, thank you, Cassie!
