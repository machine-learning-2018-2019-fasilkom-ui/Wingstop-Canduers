Cassie Jaye is currently the bravest woman in Hollywood. Her new film, 'The Red Pill' has more testosterone in it than any Kathryn Bigelow movie. To call it a must-see is an understatement as she explores an area that will instantly outrage any card-carrying feminist and at a Q &amp; A after the West Coast Premiere, Friday night, October 14, she reveals that making it cost her friendships and support from a community made up mostly of women who say they want to see more women filmmakers, but really only mean that if they're promoting material they approve of. Jaye cuts through the hypocrisy to bring us her personal experiences (a splash of narrative combined with a documentary format)when she stumbles upon a rabbit hole that swallows her up and forces her to question everything she believed in as a former feminist when searching the term 'rape culture' leads her to discover the world of the MRA. If 'The Red Pill' can't move you, your blinders are on way too tight.
