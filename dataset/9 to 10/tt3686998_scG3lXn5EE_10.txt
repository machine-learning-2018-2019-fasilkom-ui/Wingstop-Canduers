Perhaps you believe that patriarchy is hegemonic, harmful to women, that it's still a man's world. After all, most CEOs and Congresspeople are still men. If you were my brother, sister, wife, etc., I'd urge you to see this film. Yes, you'll find support for your views---After all the filmmaker was a serious feminist. Also, the movie fair-mindedly interviews leading feminists, not just straw men/women. But your eyes will be opened to an enormous reality for 50 percent of the population that has been almost totally censored by the mainstream media. I'll admit that I found two hours a bit long. I wish it had been 90 minutes but then again, I'm impatient by nature. But even Type-A me feels it was well worth watching, no, essential watching.
