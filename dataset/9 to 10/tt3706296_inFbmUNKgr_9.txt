I've just watched this on Amazon video and found it very interesting. As a radio amateur with an interest in older tech I am drawn to this era of technology when things were less well understood and things 'just got done' by people who didn't mind flying by the seat of their pants. There must be so much more of this material out there in dusty archives, surely it's time to get the old timers talking about it on a bigger scale?
