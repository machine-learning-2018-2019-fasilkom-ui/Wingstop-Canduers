Look, it is a bit uneven but the other reviewers really do hit the corners with this movie. You can lose yourself in it for a few hours and just have a laugh here and there. David Oleyowo is talented. Here he bends his acting style to being poop on the highway of life, a man who decides he is not going to take it anymore. He does not Rambo it out; he figures out what he must do. He is a gentleman turned pragmatist. Sure the movie could be smoothed out a bit but give it a break; it's funny. Oleyowo can really be funny. The trailer suggests a brisk clip and no, the movie drags a bit here and there but look, it is not bad at all. It worked for me. I had no expectations, and I was entertained. Give it a try.
