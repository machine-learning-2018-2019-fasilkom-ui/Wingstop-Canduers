I recently saw Fortitue and Glory and was very pleased with the movie. It depicts what happens when a boxer fails but continues to fight on to become successul. This movie is filled with amazing actors who truly make the film. First, Angelo Dundee and George Foreman givea a legendary performance in this film. Freddie Rooach is also good throughout the film, even though he is playing a supporting role. The casting for this movie is truly perfect, and the actors do not disappoint.One of the best things about this movie is that it's so relatable. We all have those moments when we fail but we learn to pick ourselves back up. Overall, this is a great movie with a mix of a ton of emotions all rolled into one. If you're looking for a good movie, this is undoubtedly the movie for you
