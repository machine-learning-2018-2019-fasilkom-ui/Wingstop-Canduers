Well edited and fun story about America's greatest rock band. Covers their birth and heyday extensively. Fairly discusses their troubles after the death of Terry Kath.It is also completely accurate in the discussion of Peter Cetera. Although his voice was key to many of their hits, including some of their biggest sellers, he was not a driving force of the band, and if anything is a major reason why it took them so long to get into the Rock Hall. He took them from being a great rock band and made them into Toto.Champlin was with them during their least successful period and no Chicago fan barely even knows who he was.It would have been nice to have a bit more about their lean years, since they still toured, or something about their recent albums, but in all honesty, what makes them great is their early work anyway, for which alone they are better than most of the acts that got into the Rock Hall before them.
