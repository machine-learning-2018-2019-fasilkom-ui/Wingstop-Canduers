A wonderful doc on the seminal band of the Midwest who through nearly 50 years of touring, recording &amp; multiple band member changes still endure, playing nearly a hundred dates a year. Going through the usual motions of the trajectory of most 70's bands, drug addiction, audiences (or lack there of), musical tastes that evolve &amp; accidental deaths, we get a mouthful of tastes of what the group had to put up with. If you love their music, which I do, then you'll be visiting hallowed 'VH1 Behind the Music' territory w/a big grin on your face.
