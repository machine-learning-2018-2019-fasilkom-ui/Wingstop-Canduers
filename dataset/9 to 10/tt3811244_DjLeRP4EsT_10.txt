Great writing, authentic performances, and very funny! It's unusual to see a funny movie with so many fully developed female characters. The plot nicely balances both the characters' friendships and romantic relationships, and the story line is not predictable. For fans of the 1980s and 1980s cinema, this is a must-see!Highly recommend!
