I so appreciate a good movie that can be silly and fun and entertaining with characters that I can relate to. The romantic comedy is back. It moves quickly and had me laughing throughout with fresh jokes that were hysterical. Camille Guaty always nails it, but this might be her best performance yet. I would highly recommend this film despite a few blue moments.
