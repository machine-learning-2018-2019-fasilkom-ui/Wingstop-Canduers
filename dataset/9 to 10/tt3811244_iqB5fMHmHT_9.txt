I was able to see this film during its festival run and it was definitely one of the highlights of my year. Incredibly funny and witty, it's a huge standout against its genre counterparts. Its female characters are fully fleshed out and I found myself relating to all three characters. The 1980s nostalgia adds a bit of whimsical magic to this already enchanting film. If you want to have fun and laugh with your pals, this is definitely the comedy film for you.
