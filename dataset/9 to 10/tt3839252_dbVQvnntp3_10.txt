Actor Tilo Nest IS this film, in spite of the way the actors are listed here. The film in its entirety follows his tortured character, Lorenz Fuchs, throughout. This is NOT an action film, it does NOT move fast, it is NOT in-your-face Hollywood-style. It is an intense, personal, achingly brutal in its sadness-- a character film with haunting, dread-inducing music and cinematography that left me wanting to jump into the screen to see more-- it is perfect. It is a slow-moving, moment-to-moment film in the most beautiful sense. Details come to light later that are only hinted at in the beginning-- small details that pack an emotional punch. Tilo Nest's face is in closeup through much of this movie and every single nuance is telling-- this is an actor who can unhinge your emotions with a look in his eyes. You FEEL what he feels. Beyond brilliant-- he is haunting and so very real. You will never forget Lorenz Fuchs. I'm so happy that I ignored the two stars-- too often only an indication to me that Americans have trouble with foreign films. It is 5 stars and then some. Troubling in its quiet intensity,j it is exquisite.
