Achingly depressive, painful to watch, wonderfully portrayed study of descent into self destruction. Masterful in subtlety of hints and clues that guide us through unravelling of a desperate mind destined for utter destruction. Superb cinematography and soundtrack complement the spiritual desolation; the unnerving feeling of bland hopelessness will haunt you for some time. First time in quite a while I din't regret using Netflix :) Just the the title 'AMOK' is not congruent with deliberate resolve main character carries out his plan, 'Promotion', into annihilation, fits better.
