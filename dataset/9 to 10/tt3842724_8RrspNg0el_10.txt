I loved this movie, I tried using Tinder, an online SWIPE dating app, and it has really worked in my favor. This movie is definitely based upon what will happen when you get a Tinder account, because you never know what you'll get. You'll get a bunch of gross pictures, you'll get a bunch of anxiety from a person who doesn't reply, and you'll get happy when they ask you on dates. This movie displays all of that in a funny matter. Looking for love in all the wrong places may just work out sometimes. I honestly didn't expect this film to be so funny, and all the guest stars were just the cherry on top of everything. What Now was a cute, and funny film and I hope to see more work in the future from Ash Avildsen! Bravo!!!!!
