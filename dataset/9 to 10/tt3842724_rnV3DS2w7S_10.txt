Wasn't sure if I'd like this movie as much as I did! But I was pleasantly surprised when by the end of the film, I was invested in the characters and relating to their experiences and emotional journey. I found myself caring about what happened, and rooting for the "little guys." The guest appearances and pop culture references were the sprinkles on top of this "tinder dating" cupcake. Definitely caused me to laugh out loud throughout the movie, quite an accomplishment these days!I definitely suggest this movie to anyone looking for good times with good laughs.
