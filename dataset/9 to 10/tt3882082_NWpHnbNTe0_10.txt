I don't scare easily and this film made me about jump out of my skin several times. Very suspenseful, scary and unpredictable. I can almost always figure out most possible endings, but this one really surprised me. I loved it!! I highly recommend this for a good scarefest!! Also, the setting, as a side note, is beautiful.
