I feel people are trying to rip this movie apart just for the sake of their arguments But as far as I'm concernedThe acting was more than decent ... Unlike most horror moviesGood production values ... Unlike most horror moviesGood direction and cinematography ... Unlike most horror moviesAnd above all , A story with actually a hint of Originality in it...UNLIKE MOST HORROR MOVIES.Yet, people are whining about "Umm, it should had stuck to the paranormal" ,or "that part is BS" ,and "it is not like Chucky or dead silence" .. *sigh*Yes, it could have stuck to the paranormal , but guess what it 's been done a thousand times before , and believe it or not a scary movie that is not just "another ghost story" is a lot more original aka "better" .And even the greatest movies has bullshit in them , and that goes for movies in general ... now try horror movies .Chucky ... Dead Silence ... OMG , I think you guys are right ! , How dare a movie not deliver on your every expectation ?! , *phew* almost argued with crazy there.In ConclusionYou would think we have seen enough bad to appreciate the good when we find it
