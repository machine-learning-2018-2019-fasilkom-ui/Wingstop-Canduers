This movie can be found on the Drága Elza! YouTube channel with English subtitles.First off, I don't know what the budget of this film was, all i know is they Nailed it! the actors were great. The special effects could sometimes be seen slightly out place such as snow falling be a screen effect, things like helmets, uniforms, and some props ect. looked a little to "clean" but not enough to were it seemed completely out place, mainly because the authenticity of the weapons and equipment used was well done. overall quite impressed.
