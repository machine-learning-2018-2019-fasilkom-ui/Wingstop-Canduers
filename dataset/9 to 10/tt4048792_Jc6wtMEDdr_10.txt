In hiding a bigfoot story doesn't play by the rules of movies. It ignores them and instead gives us something fun and funny. Mark Vermont is one character that really shines as his debut film. I'm not sure if he's serious or just acting. At any rate, this is one good movie. Bigfoot would be proud and most likely recommend this.
