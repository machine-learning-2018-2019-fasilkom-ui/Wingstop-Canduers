I Really Really Loved this show and being the Barrel Racer I am, I just love to see these shows Especially if it's winter out and all my shows are done this shows just make me feel alive and they always get me ready for more racing!! All in all I would say Its a great show for any horse person, someone wanting to do barrel's, and or "Normal" people wanting to see what "Horse" people do....Now English Riders Are not that stuck up yes there can be a hand full that are rude and stuck up but there are a hand full of barrel racers like that to... almost anyone is like this because they think they are better than everyone... This show is trying to get the point a crossed that no one is better than someone else and we should all see what others do before we judge them... you never know you maybe BEST FRIENDS some day or LIKE the SPORT that the play. Just take step back and watch....listen.... and learn
