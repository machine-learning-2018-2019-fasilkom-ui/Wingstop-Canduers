I saw this at the Montclair Film Festival. Its a very interesting film that looks into peoples lives everyone from people with a criminal record to the manager of barge. The film is very hypnotic with long shots of the barge with beautiful cinematography of the barges in between hearing the stories. It can be slow at times but during those slow moments you see beautiful vistas making the slow parts more interesting. Its interesting looking into a work field that not many people know about moving thees giant ships which at times can be dangerous. Represented in the storm scenes which to most people seem dangerous the people just take it as it happens everyday. I recommend this film to people who like documentaries like Hoop Dreams and American Movie. Hopefully there is a barge 2.
