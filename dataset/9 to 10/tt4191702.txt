I enjoyed the acting of Richard Gere in this movie. He did an excellent portrayal of Norman as a messed up fixer and you love and get annoyed by him all the same. The intricate nature of the characters plays out like a play and the backdrop of New York feels very well placed. The camera angle of certain characters and situations are well done and give you your hints on what is about to play out and they do but all in a very neat little package. This is an enjoyable story for all ages. Just amazing acting all around. No car smashes, blowups or guns. So nice to sit back and see real characters portrayed. A true joy.
