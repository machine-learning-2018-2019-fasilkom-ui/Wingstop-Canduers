To answer the previous reviewer about why the story stopped without including "Audio-Visions" and "Monolith", there is one main reason. Kerry Livgren had already become the main songwriter for Kansas by the time to make "Audio-Visions". Both he and Steve Walsh make reference to that in the video. What is not explained is that Kerry had a conversion experience and became a committed Christian; that shines through in both "Audio-Visions" and "Monolith" as well the reunited Kansas effort of 2000 "Somewhere Out of Nowhere". Walsh left the group after "Monolith" deciding that the musical approach of Christian lyrics and prog style was not his thang. Kansas recruited John Elefante to replace Steve but after 2 more albums, both Livgren and Dave Hope packed it in too.I never thought Steve Walsh hated Kerry for his Christian views. Likely it was more of an ego thing between them that caused friction and Steve's ultimate departure. Look up the lyrics to "Relentless", the first song on "Audio-Visions". You will not find a more powerful witness to acceptance of Jesus Christ ANYWHERE in modern music.Kansas not being in the RnR Hall of Fame is a travesty and an indictment of the smug swarminess of the NYC cretins who control the Hall's operations.
