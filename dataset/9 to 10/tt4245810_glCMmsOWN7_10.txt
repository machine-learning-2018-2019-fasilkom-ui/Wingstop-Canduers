Very gutsy film. I am interested in hearing the answers to the questions and information proposed in the film. Very well prepared. The questions and information presented are focused on discrepancy. There is nothing wrong with asking, and the individuals that created this film ask some hard hitting questions. Before seeing this film, the issues presented would have never crossed my mind. Other Sandy Hook theory videos accuse first, then offer information. We Need to Talk About Sandy Hook, offers a look in to technical evidence of an alternative point of view. It is important to respect the opinions of all individuals and respect their right to believe. Regardless of what the TRUTH is, this film offers a well presented perspective.
