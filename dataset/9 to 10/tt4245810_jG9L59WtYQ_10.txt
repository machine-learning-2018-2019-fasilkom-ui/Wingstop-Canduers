I want to thank all the producers for the time and dedication. This documentary is very well made, it contains a wealth of information and it all can be verified on the internet. There is absolutely no speculation, just facts. Just give it 2 hours of your life and you will be amazed. It may be shocking to find out that everything you knew and believed about the government is a complete lie. That we live in times where elaborate hoaxes with paid actors and complicit media is the norm. This documentary will change the perception of how people think and will start questioning the official story not only of Sandy Hook, but many other false flag events and government psychological operations such as the JFK assassination, 9/11, Boston Marathon Bombing, chem trails, Aurora theater shooting, and many others.
