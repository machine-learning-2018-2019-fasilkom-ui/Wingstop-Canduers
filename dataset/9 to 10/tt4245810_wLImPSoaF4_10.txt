And no - I'm not exaggerating in the summary. This is an amazing documentary of the Sandy Hook event. The work of the researchers since the beginning, many of whom appear in this documentary, is some of the greatest examples of true investigative journalism that exists today - you will not get this from the mainstream media or even most of the so-called 'alternative media'. It's the perfect movie - for not only individuals who are awake and already know what's going on, but also those not yet aware at all or on the fence.Clocking in at just under 3 hours, depending on your availability of time, you may need to divide it up into a couple or 3 sittings. Though, I must say - I watched the full movie in one sitting and due to the professionalism used putting this movie together it doesn't feel like a near 3 hour documentary at all, to me at least. It actually left me wanting more.I really can't say enough about how great the documentary is. I highly recommend you watch and share this it with everyone you know. I also suggest supporting those who were involved with this movie by subscribing to each and every researcher on YouTube, follow their Blogs and visit their websites on a regular basis for all of the other great work they do. They are all the very definition of true journalists.
