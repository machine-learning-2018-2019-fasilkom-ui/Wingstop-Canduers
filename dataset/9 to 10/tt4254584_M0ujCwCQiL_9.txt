1. Jordan Bred 1's 2. Fresh perspective from director Justin Tipping.3. The first film to my knowledge to incorporate BART as a character.4. The first film to shine some light on the sneaker culture.5. The film has characters who feel real to their environment.6. My favorite character in the film was Flaco, I like flawed people who are more than what they seem on the surface, he had a certain presence that was haunting.7. I loved the astronaut, once he appeared the film took on a somewhat surreal feel for me, it added a unique flavor to the picture.8. I really admire the director Justin Tipping, he made the film he wanted to make and that's what I plan to do.
