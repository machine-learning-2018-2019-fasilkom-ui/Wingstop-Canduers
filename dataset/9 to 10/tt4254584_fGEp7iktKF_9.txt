Full of suspense.... New actors with serious character profiles and personalities. Best to watch when alone cause you may react with mixed emotions. Great story line with creative twists. Movie is based in a documentary style with action movie imaging. Feels like a true story that Jordan paid for. Based in the projects and people you can relate with. Funny and motivating cheering for the good guy, feeling for the bad. Well worth watching and would recommend it even to the older aged person to watch. If you love Boyz in the hood, Friday, Menace To Society, Welcome to Compton. You will love this movie. Very Entertaining and life like story you can relate to.
