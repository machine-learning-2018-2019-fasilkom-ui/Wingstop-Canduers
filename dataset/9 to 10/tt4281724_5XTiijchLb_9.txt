I don't know why this movie is getting so much hate. This little piece of horror heaven is extremely well executed. Basic slasher concept...but you can tell there is so much more going on. They broke a mold with this one. Fantastic Gore, great villain, relatively smart and likable victims. I will probably watch it again before or on Halloween.
