As a dog lover and a Speech Pathologist, I really enjoyed this film which was shared at the recent Autism World Conference in Portland, OR. It is a heart-warming film. I hope PBS will pick this up and broadcast it soon. Autism is a complex puzzle, with many theories and therapies coming to light in the research. For many people with Autism, having a therapy dog is a great tool for emotional support, and can also help with socialization and communication with the world. Piece by piece, we need films like this to help spread Autism Awareness and Hope!
