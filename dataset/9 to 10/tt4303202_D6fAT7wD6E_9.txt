American Wrestler: The Wizard is based on the true story of Ali Afshar, a teenage boy who escapes the unrest in Iran in 1980. However, he faces more hostility in America due to the hostage crisis. Determined to fit in, he joins the school's failing wrestling team.American Wrestler: The Wizard has a great vibe to it. Because the film is based in 1980, the clothing, the mise-en-scene, and soundtrack made this movie feel like a classic 80's film. The underdog story of a scrawny kid with an inner fire who defies all odds and becomes a wrestling "wizard," places itself against other classics such as Karate Kid or even Rocky as the film is also about an immigrant outcast who's doubted in skills solely due to where he comes from.American Wrestler: The Wizard is an inspiring film that will make you smile, laugh, and cry. The film's lead actor George Kosturos did a fantastic job portraying Ali Afshar as he went through the trials and tribulations of being Iranian in America during the 1980 hostage crisis.One truly spectacular part of the film was the wrestling. George Kosturos had no experience in wrestling before this film. Yet he learned and performed all his own stunts. The wrestling holds, escapes, and moves were incredible, you couldn't look away. The wrestling scenes in American Wrestler: The Wizard were so intense that everyone in the audience was squirming in their seats, the cinematography truly puts you in the heat of the moment.
