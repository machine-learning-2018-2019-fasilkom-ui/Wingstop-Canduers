Wonderful root-for-the-underdog movie. George Kosturos' portrayal of Ali was superior--the entire cast exceptional. The movie is about a newly-arrived teenage immigrant who becomes the brunt of prejudice in the time of the Iranian hostage crisis. It is a touching and inspirational sports story showing that tenacity and strength of character win out over adversity. I cried more than once and left the theater feeling inspired. Good for kids and adults.
