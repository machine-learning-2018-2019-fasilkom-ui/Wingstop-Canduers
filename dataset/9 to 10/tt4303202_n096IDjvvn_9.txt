As a former high school wrestler in a small town this movie really resonates with me. Also very well written and believable for that period of time. If you like an underdog story and you like wrestling this movie is a 10/10 for you! Full of emotion, and good tense good old fashion high school themed beat downs. Its not that corny in the movie, but its really believable and great action and drama as well.
