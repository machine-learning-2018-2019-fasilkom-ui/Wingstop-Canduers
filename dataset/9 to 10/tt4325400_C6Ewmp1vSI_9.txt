I am used to see so much car-related material on TV/streaming/internet etc. that I have gotten a bit critical of what I am about to spend my time on watching. There's just so much junk out there. Luckily there's also documentaries/shows/clips that IS worth spending time watching, and "Apex: The Story of the Hypercar" is definitely one of them. Interesting from start to end, with beautiful pictures of fantastic cars and interviews with fascinating, interesting and inspiring people. Throughout the documentary you'll get a little bit closer to the major hypercar manufacturers, but as a red line it follows the story of Koenigsegg, whom you'll get to know the best. Not giving it a 10 score rating only because I think it should be a longer, even more "in depth", documentary.
