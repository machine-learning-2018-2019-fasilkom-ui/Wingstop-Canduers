I watched it without any expectations and have to say, you get some real entertainment here.In a nutshell, it explores three car manufacturers building the next big thing. The ultimate street legal racing machine. It does not go too deep into the details, but its very interesting to see how the people behind such projects think and act.In a world overblown with content, such pieces of art are the things that stand out.A little downside: Some of the commentary from the interviewed guys are kind of mediocre, but it does not affect the overall experience. If you are into cars or motor sports in general, or just a fan of visually pleasuring cinematography that's built upon a process of design thinking, you won't regret a look.
