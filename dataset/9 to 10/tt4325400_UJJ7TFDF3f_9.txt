Little surprised to see 1 user comment. This deserves a wider audience and more TLC. Stumbled into this little gem on Netflix. I am not an ardent car nerd but I was hooked on this intimate insight into the world of hyper cars.The close ups on the cars are almost erotic in its intensity and the pacing is very well managed. Ideally you wan to get together with some fans of F1 and cars to really enjoy this. They pay special attention to Koenigsegg and give the viewer a bonus look into the racetracks of legend in Europe (esp Nurburgring)Totally worth the investment in time.
