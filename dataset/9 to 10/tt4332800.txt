It is a rare that a filmmaker can achieve such relatable and realistic situations, and yet at the same time have it be highly engaging. If you love Duplass brother movies, you will love stuff by this filmmaker. This is one of my favorite, if not my favorite of his films. His films capture perfecting what it is like to live in LA, date and pursue a a career in the film industry in our current times. You always feel like you are right there in the room with the characters, as if you are living that life.
