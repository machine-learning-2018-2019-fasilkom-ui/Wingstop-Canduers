Everyone has already said all there needs to know about the movie.I just wanted to comment on the ending. She found with the DNA that IT WAS their son and She has decided to let him go. Especially since he is dangerous and other kids are suffering. He is not the same little lost 6 year old boy that they have lost and worried about. Good call.
