Do you enjoy an excellent documentary? Do you like Vikings? Does a compelling and candid look into an insular subculture fascinate you? Do you like seeing people getting smashed with ancient weapons in combat situations that are the closest you'll come to in the modern age to the real deal? If you said "Yes.", to any of these questions then check out this documentary. It's a great heartfelt profile of one of the members of the international organization known throughout the viking reenactment community as Jomsborg. Follow Clint from his native Texas as he trains with his local reenactment group in preparation for his participation in the European Campaign season; from the shores of Britain to the foggy inlets of Wolin, Poland, you'll meet the people and places that become the focus of a wonderful saga on film.
