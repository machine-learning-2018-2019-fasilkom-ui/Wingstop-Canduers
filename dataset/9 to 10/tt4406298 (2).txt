"That Gal" was truly entertaining and insightful.This film is a fantastic contribution to the conversation of women in entertainment. As a young woman working my way up in the industry, this film has help to increase my awareness of the pressures that female actors face. In turn, I feel inspired to speak out on behalf of women both in front and behind the camera. The female actors who are interviewed are extremely honest with the struggles they have faced throughout their careers, but also prove that women can have/do it all! Also, I want to commend the director/producers of this film for shinning a light on this topic and I look forward to their future projects!
