I was really excited for the female version of That Guy, and That Gal certainly delivered. With a cast of women demonstrating a wide range of film and TV credits, the documentary painted a frank picture of what it means to be a woman in entertainment, particularly of a certain age. This also seems to be an appropriate time for its release, given that statistics of working women in Hollywood have actually dropped over the past several years and the conversation surrounding feminism (aka equality for women) is gaining some momentum. It's helpful and impactful to see That Gal put familiar faces and their experiences to statistics. Not to mention, That Gal is also entertaining. Definitely worth seeing!
