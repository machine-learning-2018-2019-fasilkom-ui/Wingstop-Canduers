Beautiful movie! Great for the kids. Very sweet story. My daughter has rewatched this so many times. It's so nice to see something like princess bride being made these days. The cast was fantastic, I really enjoyed seeing John Cleese whom I didn't even recognize initially. Jennifer looked beautiful and was perfectly cast. Liam mcintyre was a stand out for me as well.
