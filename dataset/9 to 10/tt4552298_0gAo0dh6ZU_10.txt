If you're a fan of true-crime documentaries like "Making A Murder," the "Paradise Lost" films, and "The Thin Blue Line," this film is for you. Like those films, this one allows you to sit watching as judge &amp; jury, looking at a case through the prism of time, to see if the verdict was just. I believe, like those films, that this one lays out a persuasive argument for reasonable doubt which is no small thing. After all, it is a fact that innocent people end up in prison. Luckily, on occasion, the system corrects itself, as we read every few months when someone is exonerated by DNA. For that to happen, though, people need to care and that is why I recommend watching this film. Every voice counts.
