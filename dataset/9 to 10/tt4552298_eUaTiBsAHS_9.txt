Talk about timely! Killing for Love is one of those rare and engrossing films that not only moves deeper and deeper into the inner workings of an unjust conviction and term of imprisonment, 30 years and running. What separates this from the pack are new and critical pieces of the on-going story unfolding before the world's eyes via the international press. The only other example I can think of is Robert Durst in The Jinx (2015), although with this carefully crafted new film, there are surprises due to a variety of factors, not simply a confession as with Durst. From IMDb: "This beautifully crafted film reveals a mismanaged, or perhaps completely corrupted, judicial process. This was the first criminal trial held in front of TV cameras - the first high-profile, international case tried in a small town. Investigations over the past 3 years have turned up stunning evidence that was previously suppressed or deemed inadmissible. New forensic techniques have disproven evidence that was key to Soering's original conviction. Denied parole 12 times, his next hearing in 2017 may have a different outcome, at the same time the film is in release." See it as soon as you can and get up to speed on this intriguing and bizarre true crime story.
