The film is a very entertaining and moving documentary in the mode of past films about wrongful convictions that have wrenching consequences. I didn't know about the case or the media coverage that it generated back in the day, so appreciated the patient narrative build up towards the heartbreaking conclusion along with updates about how Jens Söring is inexplicably still in jail because of mystifying motivations or past and present politicians in Virginia. I saw a Los Angeles screening of the film that featured a rousing affirmation of the need for justice for Jens Söring. I feel the same way and hope that others can come to the same conclusion and lend their support to his cause before it is too late.
