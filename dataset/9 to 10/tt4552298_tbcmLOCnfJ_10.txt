This film is "stranger than fiction" - a real true crime story which gets under your skin. From the really first beginning you are shackled by the gruesome real crime szene footage, the touching romantic love letters with voice work from Daniel Brühl reading Jens Söring's letters and Imogen Poots reading Elizabeth Haysom's letters and the thrilling court room footage. This is one of the best documentaries I have seen and left me blown away about the injustice of the US justice system.
