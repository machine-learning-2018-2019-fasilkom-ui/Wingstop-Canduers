This is a great documentary about a horrible crime, spanning decades as the filmmakers slowly peel back public appearance to reveal new information and the emotional lives of the people involved. It reminded me yet again how complicated true life is, and that we must always stay open, must always resist the rush to judgement. I grew up in the Virginia area and remember well when these murders were committed. This doc painstakingly presents alternate versions of the event itself, and allows us to exist in the contradictory space created between two people, a swirl of deception and self-deception, loyalty and guilt - the human ecology. An intense, engrossing, deeply emotional film - I so enjoyed being invited into Mr. Soering's mind over the years. The filmmakers cannot deliver us a pat ending - it doesn't exist and probably never will - but I appreciate their intention to be fair, and to investigate. A great crime doc that turns the tables on a prevailing narrative. There are always other sides of the story.
