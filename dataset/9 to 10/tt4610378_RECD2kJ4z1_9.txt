So glad this came up in the Netflix recommended section. Anyone interested in modern European history should watch it. Acting and direction throughout was excellent I thought, it really did seem like we were witnessing wartime Amsterdam and all the hopes and fears of the brave people who resisted a brutal foreign occupation. Not for the faint hearted either. The movie gives a very realistic &amp; sometimes graphic account of how a primarily civilian resistance movement not only has to outfox military intelligence, but also the craven collaborators amongst the ranks of their fellow citizens, and the consequences of such acts of heroism.
