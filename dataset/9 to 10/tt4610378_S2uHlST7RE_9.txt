We all know the stories of the people who risked all to help others in WW2. This is one I was never aware of before and so when it came up on Netflix, I thought give it a go.Stunning movie, emotional and a story for the ages and especially now with the far right on the rise. For someone to say it was too slow is crazy and I recommend this film alongside the great WW2 movies.
