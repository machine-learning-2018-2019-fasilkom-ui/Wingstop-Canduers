Outstanding job, Cast! I felt it was a great ensemble effort. To the film crew and set designers, beautiful work.
I don't speak Dutch and enjoyed the native language and would have been disappointed to watch it in English. Turn on the subtitles and enjoy the authenticity of the real actors and not the voice-overs. 
Not understanding those who gave this film such low ratings. You might find that a great story, like this one, has to develop slowly and intently in order to convey the depth of the script and story line. The pace was beautifully executed. This film delivered perfectly. 
Thank you Netflix for bringing this to the American screen. A story that needed to be shared.
