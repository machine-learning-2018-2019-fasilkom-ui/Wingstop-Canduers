Beautifully portrayed movie about love, hope and life. These critics are unbelievable and useless. These meta scores on IMDb are dumb and useless. Its just 1 useless person doing the review job and he does not represent the entire world audience. Ignore these critics. Movie is emotionally brilliant and strong. A brilliant movie about life told in a emotionally satisfying way. The film is so pleasant to watch which portrays human emotions in a wonderful way. Will Smith has his own style and brilliance. His performance is just too good. We can really feel the movie within us. Such a nicely made movie. Don't miss it
