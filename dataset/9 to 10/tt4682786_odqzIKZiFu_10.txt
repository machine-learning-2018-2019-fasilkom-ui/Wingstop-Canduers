I'm going to keep this short since there are already so many other great reviews here to read... to sum it up though, this is a Very well put together film, with Many great elements, some of which are Very unexpected. I usually HATE dramas, and am more of a fun action / suspense / adventure kind of film guy... but every so often, a film such as this comes out, and its one that someone can easily break their usual style and enjoy.Forget all the comments giving it one star and hating on this film... they seem very short sighted in their perception, and are unable to see how every moment in this movie had a point and purpose, while being Very thought out. Perhaps some are mad at the film because they don't want to admit it made them cry a ton, while still ending in a way to feel warm about.
