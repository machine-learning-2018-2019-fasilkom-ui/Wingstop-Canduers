I absolutely loved this movie. It was very touching and sometimes extremely hard to watch. I strongly recommend you watch this movie.Pros: Acting was magnificent - especially Will Smith. He really captivates the audience with this one. The story line was well thought out and easy to follow. Anyone could easily to relate to the situations/characters. It also had a wonderful surprise ending.Cons: Just a little too long. I also would have liked for them to have gone deeper into the 3 abstract concepts.You will enjoy this movie. I suggest you bring a tissue too. :-)
