This stage play had a lot of twists and turns that kept you guessing and wanting to know what was going happen next. It touches on a lot of real life situations that some of us might have ignored or forgotten about that might be causing many of us to be single or want to stay single. The singing in this play was heart felt and touching. The laughter and audience participation had everyone on stage getting more involved in their character. Every character from the smallest part to the biggest roles brought something remember-able to each scene. I loved the character Fred and Chris they kept you laughing almost every time they appeared on stage. The little girl "Kelly" set it off from the opening of the show. I don't want to talk about the writing because I am the writer. lol However, watching everything come to life on stage had me speechless I was numbed most of the time by the great response from the audience reactions to the monologues throughout the play. Go see this play when it comes to your city. You won't be disappointed.
