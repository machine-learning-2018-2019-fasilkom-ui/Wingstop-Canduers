Wow. Just wow. A great movie about the destruction wrought by the Mexican drug trade on the innocent, in this case a group of kids left homeless and orphaned by a local drug gang. Not only do they murder the kids' parents with impunity, but they sell the kids into child sex rings. If it wasn't for the orphans' ten-year-old leader, Shine (wondrously portrayed by Juan Ramon Lopez) they'd all be dead or worse. Enter Estrella, a recently orphaned girl who brings with her three wishes, all of which devastate the orphans but bring a measure of justice, too. This is magical realism at its most tragic.
