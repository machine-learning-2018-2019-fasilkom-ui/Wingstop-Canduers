I've finished watching the movie and I'm crying with joy, horror and sadness. What a shocking, real, charming, innocent, evil and disheartening movie. A work of art of the genre made of everyday reality, where an inoperative government, corrupt and alien to its governed has allowed such a real atrocity in Mexico. A lacerating, outrageous, violent reality, without law or justice and a childhood torn, strangled and murdered by interests foreign to its purity. Beautiful allegory of innocence, camaraderie and revenge of a people whose citizens, fed up with corruption and impunity, shout justice even if it is from beyond the grave.
