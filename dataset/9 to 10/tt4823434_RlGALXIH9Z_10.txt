Maybe it's the soft spot I have in my heart for these "children in peril" films (Brazil's "Pixote", Romania's "Children Underground", Morocco's "Ali Zaoua: Prince of the Streets", Democratic Republic of the Congo's "War Witch", etc.), but Mexico's "Vuelven" (or "Tigers Are Not Afraid") definitely ranks up there with the best of them. Funny, touching and brutal, this film will make you glad you have a home in which to watch it.I can just imagine the suffering felt by other street kids in countries like India, the Philippines, Iraq, Turkey, Venezuela, Russia or even the United States. Their stories are still waiting to be told. Hopefully some brave filmmakers will get enough funds together to illustrate their plight as dramatically, and fantastically, as "Tigers Are Not Afraid."
