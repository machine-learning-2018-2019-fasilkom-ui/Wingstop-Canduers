I saw this at Imagine Film Fest and absolutely loved it. It tore me up it was so sad, but it wasn't a depressing film, it had a lot of hope and love. I loved how the lead was a girl. It also was simple, in that it conveyed great depth throughout without being self-aware or manipulating audiences feelings.
