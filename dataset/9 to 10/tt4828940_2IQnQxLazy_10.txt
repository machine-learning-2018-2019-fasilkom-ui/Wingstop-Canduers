This film is a thought provoking, emotional experience everyone can relate to. Excellent writing, solid story line, and talented actors take you on a very personal journey through the Florida wilderness. Philosophical undertones resonate through out the entire film highlighting the importance of simplicity while testing ideas and theories most of us can only dream about. Genuine chemistry between the actors and a superlative music score truly bring this story to life. I highly recommend Never Go Back, watching this film is certainly time well spent.
