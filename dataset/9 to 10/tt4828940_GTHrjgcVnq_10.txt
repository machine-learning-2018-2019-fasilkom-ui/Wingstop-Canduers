There are times in our lives where we understand that we are making a profound decision. Sometimes these decisions could never be understood by onlookers and loved ones. It seems irrational, crazy, impossible. For some there is no choice except change. These men must take new steps when the wife / mother passes. It could have never returned to normal, and it was realized . Unprepared and clumsy in the beginning of their journey, and each not discussing the reasons , but dealing with the present each day kept their lives on a forward path. But nothing is forever in the wild. I was impressed by the developing of the characters, the scenery , the concept of the story, but mainly it brought forth emotion that we often hide as we consider the value of our lives as individuals and as part of a family... And a world.
