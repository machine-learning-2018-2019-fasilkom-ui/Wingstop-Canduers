Since I wrote, directed and edited Never Go Back, I am choosing to review the film's score for 2 reasons: 1. I had absolutely nothing to do with the score so I can provide feedback from a truly outside perspective and 2. I believe that original scores do not receive nearly enough credit for the quality they have the potential to add to a film if handled correctly, which Doctor Jones, who created the original score for Never Go Back, absolutely did. First, it should be noted that nearly 2 hours of original instrumental compositions as well acoustic lyrical gems were completed in a time span shorter than 2 months. I feel the need to note this because I doubt it would ever be realized by simply hearing the score as it has the simple complexities of masterful pieces composed by renown orchestras.The thought and consideration that went into every sound that was used is to be admired and is certainly appreciated by me as the director of the film. Doctor Jones understood the purpose of the story and masterfully amplified its intentions with driving tracks that dig their way into your psyche to cement the visuals and narrative of the film in a place deeper than most films are able to travel. It is an example of the perfect marriage between two forms of media - mutually complementing each other, creating a wonderful treat for the viewer to watch unfold. Expect to hear more of Doctor Jones. This was his first original soundtrack and an experienced listener will quickly notice that only the surface of his abilities has been scratched - behind the matured talent that already exists, you can hear a world of diverse potential scratching beneath the surface.
