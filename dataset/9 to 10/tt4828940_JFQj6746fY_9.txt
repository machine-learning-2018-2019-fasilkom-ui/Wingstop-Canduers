When you watch at least 5, shall we call it, indie movies per week, your mind turns the filtering system all the way to 11 (a random reference intended). So, when your mind goes full filter mode, you automatically create an idea about the movie before you even watch it, and often it's not because you decided to do that.So, here I was watching Never Go Back, just another fish in the sea. Reading the plot summary was enough to know what kind of music it will have, where will the movie go, what's the prevailing emotion in the movie and so on. And... now you're expecting the big BUT... but there is no big BUT. I was right, or should I say, my filtering system was right.BUT, one thing it did get wrong: the movie wasn't boring. Although it guessed every single element correctly, the final conclusion was missed by a mile. And here is my question.Just because you can presume the elements, does it mean you can guess the outcome? My answer is yes, but luckily, you can't always be right. And when you realize you're wrong it's the best feeling ever. Finally something new, finally something that sparked my intrigue and switched my mind from "filter mode" to "fascination mode". That's what Never Go Back did for me.It's not about discovering new lands or god forbid, finding the meaning of life.It's about finding a great movie which is exactly that, a great movie - nothing more and nothing less.I mean, who would've thought just another fish in the sea is actually THE fish in the sea?Give it a watch, you won't regret it.
