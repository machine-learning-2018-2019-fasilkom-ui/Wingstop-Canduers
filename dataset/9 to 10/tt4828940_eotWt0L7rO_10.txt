I had a chance to see this movie when it 1st was shown. Me and my husband loved it. Their was a perfect story line, excellent suspense, perfect length not too long or too short. The actors were all A+, I expected a B or C movie at best and as a performer myself I was surprised that this movie was absolute quality and I expect to see this movie in theaters and on DVD. In fact It's a movie I would welcome seeing again as it's one of those movies you think did I get it all and if I see it again I would see something I missed. All around wonderful night out with my husband.
