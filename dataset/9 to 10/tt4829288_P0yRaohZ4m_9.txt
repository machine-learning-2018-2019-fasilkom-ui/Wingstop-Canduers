ONE STEP BEHIND is a highly effective and deeply dark Western thriller! I loved the use of the desert as the backdrop as it's so iconic to westerns. I also thought the lead actor Thoms Fisco was dynamite and menacing on a degree you don't usually see in indie films. This dude can act! The camera work really added to the feel for me and I also loved the music. Classic guitar in westerns always gets me. Lastly, there's a great twist! One Step Behind is a bonafide indie western that fires on all cylinders! NICE WORK!
