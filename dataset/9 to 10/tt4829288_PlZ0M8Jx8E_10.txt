Here's hoping the indie filmmaker's heart never turns away from the Western genre, as Mark Stephens' One Step Behind harks back to the genre's spaghetti-evocative heyday of a pre-cable youth. In doing so, it delivers darkness and efficiency of storytelling in the way that only indie really bothers to attempt anymore.Thomas Fisco has a credible edge to him in the lead role of Will, who doesn't remember the reign of darkness he's brought on the world, while those around him remember it with all-too-much clarity. More antihero than hero, Fisco conjures more than a tinge of menace when called up. It's a believable presentation, and one that the full cast benefits from.To me, if you're doing indie western, you're living and dying by the score. This one is uniquely its own, straddling the line between folksiness and the apparitional. It sells the film. Ultimately, Stephens triumphs with a blend of great concept, storytelling, and execution. One Step Behind breathes a lot of life - and hope - into a genre that's as much a part of our fabric as any.
