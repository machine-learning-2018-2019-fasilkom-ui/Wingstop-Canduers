When I first heard about Rob Lehr's story it honestly made me feel like I could take on the world. Every video concerning the documentary I've watched at least five times. If you're a Nerf fan this has potential to be your new favorite film. Even if you've never even held a Nerf gun and can't tell a maverick from a strife you'll still love it. Rob Lehr is a true inspiration to me and I can't see what he does in the future.
