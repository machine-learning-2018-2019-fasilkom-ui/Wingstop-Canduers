I think his mom would be extremely proud of him. Certainly because of what he has accomplished with, and through his music, but mostly because he has faced his demons with drug abuse and came out on the other side. 
To let addiction take his future, would allow his mother's murderer win by killing the thing she loved most. I'm not into heavy music, but have gained a new perspective. 
I admire this young man for standing up for what he believes in. 
He has taken back his power and now is on a different path. 
Now he's involved in helping bring awareness to domestic abuse and stays connected with his family. Z3
