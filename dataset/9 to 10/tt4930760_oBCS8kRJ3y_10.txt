Interesting story that succeeds at being quite horrific. The effects were well done considering the obvious low budget. Definitely a legit exorcism movie.I enjoyed it with the subtitles turned on. It kept me interested even though it was somewhat predictable at the end.A better than average Exorcist move...with subtitles.
