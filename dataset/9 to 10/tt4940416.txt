Not the most creative/unique idea but they do it well. The characters are all understandable and relatable, there wasn't a single point where I felt bored or uninterested, but most of all I think it's visuals are amazing. The backgrounds and scenery are phenomenal and I think it effectively portrays its moral well. The only reason I'm taking a point off is because of the extensive toilet humor but other than that, I have almost no criticism. A good kids movie.
