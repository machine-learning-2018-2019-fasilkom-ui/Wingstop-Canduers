Watched it 3 times during my Amazon Prime digital rental! Break out the popcorn, pizza, coke, beer, martinis - whatever is on hand because this is a fun one! The writing tells a subtext that is challenging, intelligent and cultural - it is based on the novel The Dead S.I.T.E. Parallel worlds, religion, seas draining, outer space, sexy sirens, militia, superpowers, talking heads, zombies, archeology, explosions, gore, science fiction, skulls and good acting and FX make this kitchen sink drive-in flick unique and rewatchable.
