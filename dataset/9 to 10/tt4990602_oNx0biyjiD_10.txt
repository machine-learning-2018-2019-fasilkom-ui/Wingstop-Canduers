When I watched this film for the first time, I was not only blown away by the beautiful cinematography and breathtaking shots of the river, but was also deeply moved by the human aspect of the film. I wanted to be Genevieve in the film and I think the modern trio who took the same route down the Colorado must have felt at times that they were embodying the French trio who preceded them. I have recommended this beautiful film to friends and family, outdoor enthusiasts and history buffs alike. I must add that this film is not just a serious revisiting of adventurers long gone. It is humorous at times, and honest while it openly explores the challenges of facing your fears and gracefully moving towards the challenges that make life a beautiful adventure.
