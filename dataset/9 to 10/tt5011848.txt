A very cool mix of science fiction and thriller. Combines classic elements of the genres and asks questions about where technology is taking our humanity. There are hints of pieces you have seen before but puts all the pieces together in an original, entertaining, think-piece. I am looking forward to the next film from Writer, Director, Royce Gorsuch.
