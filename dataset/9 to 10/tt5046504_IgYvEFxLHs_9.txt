I was delighted and surprised with this movie. Beautifully shot in different parts of Brazil and the actors did such a great job. A mix of love stories with a touch of comedy. Great taste in picking the songs. Not a typical South American movie but a very todays' blend with the help of cell phones in the middle of nowhere to solve a broken parent's relationship; and the hope and vision of a young couple's insecure wedding plan.
