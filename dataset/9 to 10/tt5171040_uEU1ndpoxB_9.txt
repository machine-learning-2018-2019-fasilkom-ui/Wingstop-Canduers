Cowboy Billy's OK Corral is a delightfully retro series of silly sketches, stories and songs geared toward teaching very young children values of kindness and consideration for others, among other valuable lessons. It has a homegrown, unsophisticated, just folks charm that just keeps you watching and smiling. The look, writing, performances and animation of the video is purposely, decidedly low-tech, a throwback to the influential cartoons and kiddie shows of baby boomer youth. Bill Dougal as Cowboy Billy is the host (and writer and co-director and songwriter and more). His old-world, laconic singing and performing ways honed through years of kiddie show performances really capture that style as he gently guides a small audience of very small kids through his goofy cowboy world. Co-director Suzanne LaTulipe provides the animation of Bill's drawings, often inventive editing, and as a performer, sings real bad (on purpose) and blows up real good. A retro treat.
