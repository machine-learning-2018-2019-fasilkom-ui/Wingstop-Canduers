This movie rocks. No, really it literally rocks. Lydia's amazing talent is reason enough to see this movie but the behind the scenes look into an upcoming star is fascinating, funny and moving. Gorman does an excellent job of showing how this unlikely cast of characters came together to make some truly inspirational music. Lydia's talent is clearly the driving force behind the band but it is very interesting to see each members roll and how they have become a family. The concert footage is some of the best I have ever seen. It Makes you want to jump in a car and follow Lydia around. There is also some great comic relief from the band mates and animation. Bottom line, Lydia is a bad ass and this movie is a must see for all music lovers.
