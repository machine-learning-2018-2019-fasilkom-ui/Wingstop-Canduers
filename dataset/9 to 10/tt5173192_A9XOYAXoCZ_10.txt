I caught this movie as part of the Boston Independent a Film Festival this year (2016). There are documentaries that make you think about the subject for the few hours after you see it, there are documentaries that are well done but don't inspire discussion, and then there are documentaries that force you to immerse yourself in the subject at hand. Gorman Bechard's latest rock doc falls into the last category. At least once a day I find myself thinking back to some part of this movie. The story focuses on the lifeblood of a working musician-recording and touring. Excellent interviews with Lydia and her band throughout give us the answer to this question. Like most subjects there is not just one answer you will come away from the movie with an appreciation for the challenges it takes to be an artist in a world which appears to put less value on art.
