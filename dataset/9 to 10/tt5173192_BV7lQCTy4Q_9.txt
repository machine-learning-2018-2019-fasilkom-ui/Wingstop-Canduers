Gorman Bechard is a documenter of those that history has forgotten and those it has not yet discovered. He finds creative ways of working his way into an artist's life like a puppy. Hanging around long enough to be endearing, and then long enough to become a part of the furniture. The truths start to boil to the surface and we get to see the true face of the artist. It helps that Lydia is a powerful songwriter and performer. If you haven't heard of Lydia before seeing this film, by the end you'll feel like you've known her for a very long time.
