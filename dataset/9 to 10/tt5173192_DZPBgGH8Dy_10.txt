I loved this documentary for baring all the Heat &amp; Soul and Warts and all of Lydia. I was pleasantly surprise on how each band member was featured &amp; how much they contribute to the overall sound and spirit of Lydia Loveless the band. They fellow musicians are not only talented in their own right, but downright Funny!! Lydia herself was quite candid in this documentary and you get to see what makes her tick, come along for the ride in the songwriter process and party after the show with the band. One thing I did learn for sure from this documentary is that you cannot put Lydia Loveless in a box, she will scratch &amp; kick her way out of it. A Must watch for true Rock N Roll Fans and for those of us who keep hoping for a Carson Drew Reunion.Coney
