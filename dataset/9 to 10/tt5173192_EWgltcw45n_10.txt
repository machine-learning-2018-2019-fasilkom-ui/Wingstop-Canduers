I absolutely loved this documentary of Lydia Loveless, which I saw at an Chicago film festival.Loveless' music is pretty well known among fans of Alt-Country/Americana rock, but aside from her reputation for solidly written songs and frequently messy but very enjoyable shows, I don't think there's been as deep a dive into what makes her tick as this film provides.Intimidating and adorable all at once, Loveless comes across as ridiculously smart, which I don't think I'd know unless I saw the film. Her lyrics are very clever, and this film does a fantastic job of showing the viewer from which parts of her personal history that cleverness comes from.There are tons of well-shot and exciting performances throughout the film, and without giving away too much, the film nears it's close documenting a performance of Loveless' "Boy Crazy" that is completely intense, surprising, and enthralling. I've watched a zillion rock docs, and this particular song performance is one of the most compelling 7 or 8 minutes I've seen in such a film.Can't wait for this one to become available online or DVD so I can share with friends.
