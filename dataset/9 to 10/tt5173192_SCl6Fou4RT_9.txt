Being a fan of Lydia's music I was certainly predisposed to like this film. The filmmaker brought so much more to the party, with the visual treats of the funny animation and the photo albums for example. The style reminded me of other docs like 'We Jam Econo' but has its own flair. The biggest charm of course is Lydia herself. Admittedly slightly alienated from society yet at the same time very charismatic, the push-pull dynamic of her is fascinating. Her band mates are fantastic supporting players in every way.This film goes into my highest echelon of music documentaries. I look forward to seeing Gorman's other films.
