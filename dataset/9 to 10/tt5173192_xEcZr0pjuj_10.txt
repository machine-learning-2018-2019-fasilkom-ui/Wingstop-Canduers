I'll be honest – I attended the screening in Raleigh for the solo performance after the movie. At live shows, Lydia's amazing vocals are often overwhelmed by the mix of her band, so eight hours of travel was well worth hearing her solo. I was initially skeptical of a movie about her – at just 25 years old, exactly how do you fill almost two hours of screen time??? But I came away really impressed. The movie is extremely well constructed, with artifices and devices that move the story in an interesting way. The scrapbook motif was brilliant, although the "super heroes" could have been left on the cutting room floor. Even if you have no idea who Lydia Loveless is (your loss), this movie is put together in a way that will draw you in.
