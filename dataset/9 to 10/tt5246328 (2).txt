I have been a fan of his style since Gasland. I had no idea where this would take me. It is an emotional journey told in many locations. It helps give a world view of the problems we face. Anyone calling this fake or bashing Josh Fox clearly has no sense of the enormity of the problem. It is good as an introduction to expanding environmental concerns, but also good for someone who knows quite a bit, but either wants to learn more through different angles or global beauty and alarm. My most admired activists are in it, plus very new ones adding their own view and work from around the globe. I love that Josh "interjects" himself. It is like you are on this journey with a friend. There is beauty, danger, fear, calm, pain, tragedy, and dancing. All interwoven with facts. It is the kind of journey where you appreciate a friend.
