We went to see this documentary in our town this week during its tour and found that the content is motivating. We saw that we must make a commitment to speak out to our government representatives and become a community of people that are willing and able to fight oil and gas industries which have no conscience. This documentary made me get up and dance in tribute to the earth. The documentary tells us that green solutions are attainable; our nation has all the technology to do. This documentary helps us to see we are not alone in the fight against gas, oil, and fracked-gas infrastructure that we do not want or need, that those industries do not care that they are causing our planet great harm, and that we need to unite our nation toward going green. The documentary is long but worth the time spent watching it.
