As a crps patient I was very moved by the stories in this film. And to see the perspective from the families, doctors, and caretakers was very touching. I know a lot of us lose family and friends after a period of time after diagnosis. I do hope Charles Maddox makes a second film and focuses on those of us that do not have access to specialists and treatments. A lot of us have to rely on our family physicians to take care of us. With the vast amount of ways crps affects us besides the extreme pain I know our doctors get overwhelmed. We struggle to get the appropriate medications or they've been drastically reduced so our mobility and abilities are drastically reduced as well.
This film is absolutely beautiful and it does show how crps takes over our bodies and lives and how it affects everyone involved in our lives as well. As a single mom of 3 young children, a sick mom is all they know. I truly hope crps gets the recognition it desperately needs and us as patients get the respect we deserve. The CDC and emergency room staff should be required to watch this film so no more crps patients die waiting to get the help we so desperately need. Thank you Charles Maddox!!!
