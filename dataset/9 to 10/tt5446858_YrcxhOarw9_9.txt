I would like to say, so it answers a few of you that posted here, I am NOT an IT person nor do I know much about pcs other than the average stuff.I was captivated throughout this movie, loved the little surprise at the end with the NSA "agent". I didn't know about this attack, if i did hear about it back then, it went right over my head so I am happy to have seen this movie and will get to bed a little less naive tonight. Totally enjoyed that it tried to include many facets of this story, from politicians to actual cia/nsa and other agencies, in 3 countries. Opens a debate about future policies, shows how relatively easy it is to tear down a country(not fiction anymore like too many still think) and more. Someone suggested that the politics don't have room in this story LOL, how stupid a comment, this story is all about the politics behind it.I liked it also 'cause it shows how the US Gov, interferes with other nations and then complains when it bites them in the ass down the line. a story within a much bigger story, hence why I think this movie or story would not be of much interest if we didn't see the politics that created it. The tech stuff is easy to understand even for someone like me that is no more than an avg joe, last time I understood computer language was on my commodore-64 back in the early 80's(basic).I think this movie will please many people for diff reasons. I wish all the Obama/Hillary lovers I read on FB posts would watch this movie and be better informed with their comments :o) Reasons why I really liked this movie: I love real life stories almost every time. I like conspiracy theory stories, I like when the US gov is shown for what it truly is(not often enough), Not sure what is the x-factor but there was one for me watching this movie, I was captivated from beginning to end, Kudos to all involved in the making of this film/documentary. Was made in a way I had not seen before, can't quite put my finger on it though.
