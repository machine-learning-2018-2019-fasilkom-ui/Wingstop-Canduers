This is an amazing documentary, specially when you understand that no one really wants to admit any involvement, and no one really has the full knowledge of understanding how it can be used, without the boomerang effect.Ultimately, you may come to the conclusion to better shut down all nuclear weapon sites, because they may well go off in our own hands, when they would try to launch them.Ultimately, I come to the conclusion that cyberwar possibilities might finally lead us to a peacefull planet, because every big country has the ability to destroy the entire economy of any big country, within seconds, with an usb stick.And it's the first time the USA are afraid, really afraid of Russia, China, Iran, India, Pakistan.
