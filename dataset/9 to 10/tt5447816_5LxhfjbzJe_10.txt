I want to start by saying that I do not use to write reviews here. I am not that skilled and English isn't my first language and that does not help me either. Now back to the review. THIS IS AMAZING. I am perplexed by how little people voted. 92 as am I writing. This could have a chance to the Oscars maybe. The story is pretty sad and the feelings that this film offer leave a blank space in your heart. But that's not all, the angles and all the filming are very well done. The actors give a strong performance. Just go and see it!
