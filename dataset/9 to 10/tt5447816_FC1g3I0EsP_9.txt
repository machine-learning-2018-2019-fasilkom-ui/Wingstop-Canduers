From Nowhere was warmly received in its world premiere at Austin's SXSW Film Festival. It is a powerful film about the struggles facing three undocumented teenagers who are about to graduate from high school in the Bronx and are trying to seek political asylum. The script is well-written and the young actors do a great job. From my perspective the film creates a means for those who don't know much about the complex situations faced by undocumented immigrants to see their humanity. In a political climate where demagogic politicians are busy dehumanizing immigrants, it is important for the public to see them as individuals with families, personalities, and complicated individual struggles. I would love to see this film gain a wide release and, if not, I hope there are ways for it to be used in schools for educational purposes.
