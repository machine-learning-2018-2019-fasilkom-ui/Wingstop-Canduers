The stark, not-talked-about-enough inequity of directing opportunities for women in film and TV is masterfully revealed in this impactful documentary. The topic is explored through interviews with women directors at all career stages, highlights from their films, and, this question asked of moviegoers: "Can you name a woman director." A must see for all concerned about inequities of all kinds but particularly those caused by sexism.
