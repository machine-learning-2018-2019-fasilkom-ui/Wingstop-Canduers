I didn't know what to expect when I walked into the theater, but as someone who dabbles in their own form of musical art, I was inspired by watching this story of a man going to the ends of the earth to study a fringe form of music, in hopes of bettering his own art in ways not yet known to him. It's a spiritual experience to see the majestic land of Tuva on the silver screen, but even more so as these ancient and modern vocal techniques are linked together by open-minded passion. Even if you don't have an artistic bone in your body, you should still see this for the sake of the visual experience, alone.It was well worth seeing, and I hope to see it again.
