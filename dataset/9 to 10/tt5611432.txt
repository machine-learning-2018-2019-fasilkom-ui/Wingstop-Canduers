Saw this at Cinequest Festival in San Jose / Redwood / Silicon Valley. Didn't know what to expect but found myself sucked in from the start. The film showed a respect for its female characters, all strong performances, in a way we still dont' see enough of these days. It was a slow burn that got uber intense by the end. Thought the visuals and digital effects were pretty out of the box for this type of movie and aesthetic-wise, I would could probably best call it the love child of Virgin Suicides and Enter the Void. Which is pretty cool if you think about it cuz neither is sci fi or horror. But it felt natural to the story. Still find my mind wandering off to this indie flick's weird and artful cliffhanger ending and really really want to know what the hell happens next.
