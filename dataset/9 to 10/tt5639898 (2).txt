This movie gave me all the feels! Theresa Bennett humorously delivers the plight of being a young woman navigating love, career and relationships in Trump's America. While she tackles serious yet relatable issues she still manages to bring the laughs and keep you wanting more. Her characters are multi dimensional and certainly reminded me of myself and best friends growing up. This writer/director brings the goods! A must see!
