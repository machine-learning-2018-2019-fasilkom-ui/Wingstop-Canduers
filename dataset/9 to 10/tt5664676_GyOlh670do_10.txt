A lot of positive messages came from this enjoyable movie. It was great to see an individual not caught up in the popularity frenzy nor tainted by attained wealth. Even though the story is made up, it can still yield an example of good things to emulate. Particularly touching was the fact that a family had lost a parent/spouse yet over time they were able to adjust to the loss and keep the dreams alive. The depiction of affluence and worldliness next to down-home goodness reminds us of what is better to seek for. The use of texting made for a wonderful use of technology of our day in the telling of the story. It was hilarious and left you with a good feeling. Don't stop bringing us these kinds of experiences. Hollywood's usual alternatives are not a match for good, wholesome cinema like this.
