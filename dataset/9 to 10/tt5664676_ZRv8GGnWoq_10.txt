I was in this wonderful movie as an extra. Meeting Christopher Gorham and Sebastian Roche was a dream come true and just to be at the premiere and see the complete movie was an even bigger dream. This movie is a cute, romantic, funny, emotional roller coaster and oh do i love roller coasters!!! #WeLoveYouSallyCarmichaelSuccess - i'd give this movie a 100/10 if i could! You must watch it!
