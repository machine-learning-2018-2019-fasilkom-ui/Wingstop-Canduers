"We Love You Sally Carmichael" is a clever, funny, and clean comedy with a great parody aspect. I cried the whole movie from laughing so hard. I had no, or perhaps low expectations for this film, but did anticipate some light-hearted humor. What Gorham has done is a brilliant hybrid of "Utah humor" and Hollywood caliber casting, screenplay, music and directing. What I love about this movie is it is a CLEAN comedy with excellent acting and a stellar screenplay. You can bring the whole family to this movie. It pokes fun at the Twilight series phenomena (in my humble opinion) and that makes it even better. I myself am a Twilight fan, but not one of those crazy fans--of which this film has plenty. The movie is set and filmed in Utah and--coming from a homegrown Utahn--is perfectly authentic. All the way down to the radio co-hosts telling the news to the morning segment "Good Things Utah." If you're afraid you'll find religion in this movie, fear not, as there isn't any, other than the admittance of the protagonist author that he is a Mormon. There are no words for how great, or how funny this film is. I can't wait to see it again and own it and enjoy it over and over again.
