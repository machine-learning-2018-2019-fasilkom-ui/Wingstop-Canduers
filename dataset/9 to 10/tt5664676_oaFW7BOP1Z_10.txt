I LOVED this movie! I took my sisters, my daughter, my 81 year-old mother, my girlfriends and my 10 year-old granddaughter -- what movie can you do that?!? The story line was adorable; the jokes were clean and fun (and I wasn't embarrassed to have my mom &amp; granddaughter there!); and we all laughed til our sides hurt! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! It will be 2 hours well spent!
