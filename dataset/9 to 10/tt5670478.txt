Who knows what is on the other side of the fence? It's hard to imagine how many incidences of chemical dumping that took place in the past, have gone unnoticed. The Safe Side of the Fence does a great job in investigating a time in history when protecting the the natural environment was the least of the United States of America's concern. This documentary is well written, shot and edited. The interviews and field work kept my attention. It puts a face and name to the Who, and more important, what is behind those tall guarded fences. The byproducts of secret industries hired by the government, has reared it's toxic head in the middle of our rural communities. It's a shocking revelation as to what is there and what is being done to clean it up or contain it at best. I recommend you should watch this and it will have you looking at your surroundings a bit closer. I think it's just the tip of the iceberg of whats hidden right under our feet. I live and work in the San Fernando Valley Ca. I know I'm walking on WW2 toxic waist.
