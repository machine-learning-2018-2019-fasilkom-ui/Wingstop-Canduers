Think of Paul Thomas Anderson's Inherent Vice, David Lynch's Mulholland Dr, Brett Ellis's Rules of Attraction and you might get a feel as to what you'll find in this title...This film ceratinly isn't for everyone! Surreal undertones, obscure scenes and some controversial storytelling which'll push it in cult status in years to come. The film also touches onto the classic Noir genre of the 1950's and does it very well. Perfomances from actors are great and engaging and the strange storline really pulled me in. Its definitely a journey well worth the duration if you're into something totally different to the generic releases being pushed into the mainstream these days!9.5/10 a brilliant film
