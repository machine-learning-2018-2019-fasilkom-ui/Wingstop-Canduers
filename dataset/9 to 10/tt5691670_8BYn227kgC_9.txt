I came in with no idea what to expect, and was really pleasently suprised! The movie had a great classic hollywood style score, mixed with a retro-modern visual style and a mysterious dark ambience. The plot was servicable enough, and Andrew Garfield was very charming and funny. There was a lot of nudity and some snippets of gory visuals, but nothing exessive (exept for one scene maybe). I'd defenitely recommend it!
