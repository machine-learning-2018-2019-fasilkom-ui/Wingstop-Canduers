Some may feel like the title is misleading. Then again, what title would fit this movie? I didn't really think too much on that, since I quite liked the movie. Now I can understand what people don't like about it (it seems without a point or goal, main character is not that likeable, some may feel sexist tendencies poking through).If you can accept this as a movie that is all over the place, does not try to be political correct (quite the opposite) and tests the boundaries of storytelling and character arcs, you may find pleasure in watching this, just as I did. The things you don't find ethical, show that you are "good". Btw something the movie does comment on too. You may like that pragmatic touch or not, but it is there. And while you can also consider it a bit cliche, the way it is woven into the story makes it kind of unique.Again, this will not be something that will touch many people (as is evident by the rating already), but those who get behind it, will love it with all they have. You just have to find out on which side you are on
