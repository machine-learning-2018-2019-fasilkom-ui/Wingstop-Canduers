This movie doesn't only describe something called as "revolution", but also tells a lot about the history of Ukraine what makes the picture more understandable for people not familiar with Ukraine. I lived in Kiev when everything happened, I was always pro-western and supported European integration and I support it now while living in the US. I went to the protest when the President refused to sign the Association with the EU, his arguments were not really convincing for me. I walked among the people for about an hour then suddenly I saw a girl with a hammer in her hand who started braking windows of the city hall, then some more people joined her. I looked at the protesters, they were aggressive, I felt like they were blaming the president in all their problems starting from a broken fork ending with a cheating partner. I left, I was disappointed, I's against aggression, I came to a peaceful meeting and didn't want to be arrested together with those criminals. What I want to say is that this movie tells about what I saw with my own eyes, it's not someone's opinion - it's a history which must be heard. I lived in Ukraine all my life and nothing in this movie goes against my memories or memories of my relatives. I highly recommend this movie for everyone, it explains why and how everything happened and why the only people who lost were ukrainians fooled by ukrainians and their desire to blame someone in their sins.
