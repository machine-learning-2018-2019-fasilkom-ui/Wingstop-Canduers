This documentary is not going to get an Oscar (though it should). But then again, Oliver Stone said they will not allow Trump to win.I have lived for many years both in the USA and Russia and was always dismayed by how media manipulated public in the States on all possible tiers. In Russia you have state-run TV-channels, but in the States you get the whole propaganda shebang - not just news and books, but Hollywood as well. Decent journalists come around - but they're out of the scope for most.Oliver Stone's new documentary is the most concise and clearest outlook of current situation in Ukraine with no embellishments or lies. The author gives a spin to the story though. Unlike with most stories on Ukraine, it does not carry a load of anti-Russian hysteria. Instead, he explains how the situation in Ukraine can affect anyone on Earth because of how the world elites peddle their agenda in this poor country.P.S. In other comments you may notice how emotional some Ukranians get over this documentary. That is part of propaganda war raging in minds of these people. I dare you to see and judge for yourself.
