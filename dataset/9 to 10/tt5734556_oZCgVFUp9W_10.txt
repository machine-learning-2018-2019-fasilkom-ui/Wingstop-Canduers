LOVED this story! it was like the original Evil Dead! totally sweet!!! It was more funny then scary though. I totally love MORE-on productions. especially after this one. the suspense is well timed and the ending will make you wonder what is going on. met the guy who made it at Odyssey Con Madison Wisconsin. He totally is cool. I don't mind that i bought the DVD but i found out you can stream it with amazon for free with Prime. so that's a bit of a bummer.
