1. Must Watch. 2. The best Movie I watched after "03 idiots" &amp; "Dangal". 3. Akshay at his best. 4. Bhoomi Pednekar is a delight for Hindi Cinema. She did more than excellent job. 5. Divyendu (Akshay's friend) is the best intake in comic role. 6. Anupam Kher is as usual at his best. 7. Sudhir Pandey did perfect justice to his role. 8. Script is well knitted &amp; director has full control on the minutest details. 9. Each scene is well directed. 10. Akshay is redefining his own benchmark in each film. He has developed a perfect comic sense &amp; timing to deliver dialogue. 11. Overall a genuine social cause has been presented in a perfect frame which penetrates deep into the hearts of each Indian, whether the person has a toilet in his home or not. 12. The best scene of Akshay in my opinion that moved the audience is, while the toilet he constructed for his wife, was ruthlessly broken by his own father. OVERALL TOILET is a perfect combination of social cause &amp; entertainment. movie deserves TAX FREE in all over India. Akshay you are already an inspiration to millions in many aspects but after this movie, billions would love you.
