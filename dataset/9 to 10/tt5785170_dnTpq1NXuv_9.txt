Toilet ek prem katha- The best movie of 2017 on social issue. Akshay kumar was fantastic, his acting was powerful. Bhumi pednekar is best with her acting and also best suit in this role hope her best from her incoming films. Only the songs makes the film a little bit bore. Otherwise the film is best and watchable.
