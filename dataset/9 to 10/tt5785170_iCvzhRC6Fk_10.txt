I myself never thought of watching this movie having a weird kind of name Toilet -Ek Prem katha....but once the movie starts and shows the struggle of two lovers just for a toilet....it becomes interesting at each and every moment ...the film never looses its grip from the story and keeps on astonishing with surprises and twists....Moreover the at each and every moment there is a logic for. Normally which we don't see in some of the third grade comedy movies...Songs also beautifully inserted into the movies without feeling you bored over there even if you are not a song lover.....More than this the movies ultimate aim is to fight against the narrow minded ness of the society which thinks a toilet can not be built in Home and that will opoosite of our culture...but the things it beautifully explains to those who think like this in their own language ...Thanks Akshay and his team for choosing this subject for the benefit of society and for viewers an ultimate comedy movie
