i wonder why people saying this is a bad movie. the movie is nicely acted and the love story is a part of it. In comparison to the crap released today, this one is very nice and entertaining movie. i hope people see it in neutral view. we should encourage such movies. off course there is some drama, but why not, its a movie. You can watch this with your family.
