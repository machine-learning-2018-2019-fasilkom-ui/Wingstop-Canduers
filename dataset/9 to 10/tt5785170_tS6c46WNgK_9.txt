This is best movie to watch, this is value of money..... Good comedy and dialogue with best direction. Good acting of akshay and other co- actors. This is the film you won't feel bore during the full movie. Movie is able to bind the audience till end. Background of the film is based on God Krishna's birth place MATHURA. They used local language very well. This is fully entertain, good time pass with valued money. I recommended to you to go to watch "Toilet ek prem katha".
