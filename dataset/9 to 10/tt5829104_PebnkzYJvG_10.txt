I'm beyond surprised with this one. A gem in the horror genre. Got a mix of everything..comedy..horror...gore and blood...mystery...excitement etc. loved the entire cast especially McKinley, Romeo Miller and poncho moler from 31 ,mayor Fowler (never seen any other roles he played but def will look for more). Highly recommended.
