I typically veer from horror movies, but enjoyed watching this movie. The premise is good, and the story flows. It avoids an onslaught of cheap, gratuitous, and sensationalistic gore, and leaves much of that to the imagination--the "horror" is in the storyline, not in special effects. One can easily focus on any of several of the characters and delve into a satisfying psychological/sociological discussion; one can just as easily simply watch it and have fun with it. I'd like to see a sequel.Now, if every movie you watch has to have the gravitas and cinematic weight of a Fellini, then perhaps you should stick strictly with Fellini. This movie accomplishes it's goal, and should be rated on that alone.
