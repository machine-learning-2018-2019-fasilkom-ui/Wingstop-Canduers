When I saw the kickstarter campaign video I knew I wanted to see what Sam &amp; Mattie could come up with. They were oozing with creativity and the idea sounded ridiculous.The film is about two brothers who must fend off a zombie apocalypse sent from the depths of hell by Satan himself. How good was it? I was supposed to be finishing a project and thought I would give the first 5 minutes a go just to see what it was like and I watched the entire thing including all the "dvd extras" and felt compelled to write this review. It's really good. Especially considering the budget and experience. I haven't laughed out loud that much since Guardians of the Galaxy 2. Seriously memorable quotes and sometimes outrageously dark, yet delightful humor. Some top notch performances from all the actors with special commendations to the devil, Eric, Sam and Mattie. The cameo appearances were better than I expected and I loved some of the special FX, especially the style during the jet pack scene, I don't want to spoil anything by explaining it too much in detail so just go and check it out. It left me wanting more. What could they get up to next?
