I seen the movie as motivational and inspirational. I have many reasons! Okay! well women are not known to go after what they want. Sadly women are still til this day intimidated by the ones above them. Meagan Good's character was that way until she realized she's not going to wait for love she's going to search for it. Love doesn't always show up at your door step unknowingly. She embraced her worth with taking a huge step and chance with her job and she end up coming out on top because she realized she was worth it. Keri Hilson's character I liked also because she knew what she wanted when she married her husband she wasn't ashamed to let her wants and likes to be known. She embraced herself as well. Women are known to put their feelings and wants on hold because of being ashamed of how something may seem to look to others. As for Keller Stewart I liked her character as well. She showed that love is love it doesn't matter who you end up with. Humans are humans there's nothing wrong with having an attraction to both sexes. They fell for each other's hearts, minds, bodies and souls not the fact that one had dealt with both sexes prior. It's obvious her mate's character was just trying to find himself. I liked that it wanted people to see no one's life is perfect, nothing comes easy and life is all about taking chances hence the reason Meagan Good's character did what she did at the end of the movie regarding her job.
