As the star and executive producer for this movie Jessica Williams was involved with the development of the character and the story of The Incredible Jessica James from concept to creation. Ms. Williams is famous for her reports on racism, sexism, and homophobia as a Daily Show correspondent and she gives a more personal take on gender and race as the co-host of the podcast 2 Dope Queens. She spoke at the Women's March at Sundance saying "If you are a minority, please know that you are valid. Your thoughts and your feelings are valid. I stand with you, I hope you stand with me." Jessica Williams truly is incredible and given all of this, it is no surprise that this movie smoothly passes not only the Bechdel test, but also the DuVernay test (race), AND the Russo test (lgbtq). Excellent movie! #RedirectOurScript
