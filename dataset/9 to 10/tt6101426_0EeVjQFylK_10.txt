Amazing film the documentary showed the huge role that physical education plays on society. It really made me want to make a difference in the world through physical education. It made me realize just how important health and physical education is to our society. The film is vital and necessary for the next generation and beyond. I really love the aspect of connecting mind, body, and spirit.
