I have looked up to Todrick Hall for many years after seeing him on American Idol, binge watching his YouTube video's, going to multiple concerts and traveling to see him in NYC as he starred as "Lola" in Kinky Boots. This Documentary is fantastic. I love watching the creativity Todrick Hall puts into his work. Without giving away spoilers, this documentary will take you behind the scenes of the Amazing Todrick Hall, and him pouring his entire heart into his creations. He is Brilliant. If you enjoy talented, kind, hard working individuals, I 10/10 recommend you watch this documentary.
