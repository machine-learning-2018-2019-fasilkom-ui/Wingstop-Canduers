One of the reviewers here indicated that Todrick is egotistical and narcissistic for producing his documentary 'Behind the Curtain'. The very thing he sees as a fault is why I admire him. I ran across his 'Greatest Showman' video after watching the movie. I was VERY impressed and felt it portrayed the spirit and passion of the songs superbly. It took me several weeks more to look up this artist. He had just released 'Forbidden' and I fell in love with him as a performer. Why had I not heard of him before? I know more than I want to know about Cardi B and I've yet to see a full length video of hers. What I do know is that she is making some serious change on what I think is subpar talent (my own opinion). While Todrick is struggling to write and produce his visual album as well as put on a tour on what appears to be mostly on his own dime.He is wildly talented, and a self-made success of mostly his own means. It sounds like he self-publishes his own content and doesn't have a record company to back him. Why? Why would a obviously talent like Todrick have to do everything himself? Because he is deemed unmarketable by corporate record companies. If they can't put him in certain profitable niches, then they want no parts of him. Other than mostly Broadway interviewers, I have not found any music related publications doing reviews of his music.He is invisible to a certain degree. He said this over and over again and even wrote about it in 'Dumb'. He's created all of his own content thus far, so why wouldn't he advocate for his own projects? Why wouldn't he want people to know more about him and what he believes in and want to be a part of his music? It's a no brainier. If you can't advocate for yourself nobody will.
