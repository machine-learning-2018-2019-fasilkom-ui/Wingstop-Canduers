Todrick truly gives his fans, which are known as Toddlerz, an inside look into his creative process and how he brings his ideas to life. You see happy moments, stressful moments, and some crisis moments. It's amazing to see how Todrick can pull an album and a tour together so fast, it's just incredible. He directed, starred in, danced in and sang in every song and video. If you want to know what talent truly is, watch this documentary and see how talented Todrick is!
