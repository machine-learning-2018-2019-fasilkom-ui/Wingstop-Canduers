I saw this documentary at a LGBT+ film festival and my oh my So many tears were shed during this documentary! This documentary really showed the true side of Todrick Hall. This documentary showed just how hard and long Todrick works as well as Team Toddy. Having been a toddler (Todrick fan) for almost 3 years, I've never seen such an authentic side of Todrick portrayed as this documentary did. Katherine did an amazing job documenting the Straight Outta Oz tour and production and the cast members (whom one I'm very close to). I would rate it more than 10/10 because this documentary definitely exceeded my expectations!
