I Really Enjoyed this filmed. It will inspire you to never give up on your dreams and to keep pushing towards your goals. He went from American Idol to Broadway! I love how it takes u behind the scenes of his life and the back story of who is is today. And what got him to the amazing person that we fell in love with. I really loved seeing Todrick on American idol and then i fell in love with his youtube videos and his film Straight outta Oz. So when i watched this i was just amazed how hard working he is. he is truly a inspiration. The film will make you cry and laugh.he is really So Amazingly talented i will forever be a fan. Amazing movie! Amazing Cast. Defiantly a must see.
