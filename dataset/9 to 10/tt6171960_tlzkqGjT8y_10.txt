I'm always left in complete awe of Todrick and his immense talents when I watch his videos online, see him perform on stage, and I can say the same for this documentary. I'm in AWE! Getting the opportunity to see how much work he put into the music, visual album, and stage production from start to finish was beyond inspiring. Todrick is a force to be reckoned with! It's completely evident he put his entire heart and soul into this project. Katherine Fairfax Wright did an absolutely incredible job documenting every moment with Todrick and his team. I really feel like I got a true sense of life "Behind the Curtain". I highly recommend you check out this film, as well as all of Todrick's content on YouTube!
