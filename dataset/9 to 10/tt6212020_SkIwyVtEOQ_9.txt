total mystery all the way to the end. couldn't figure it out and Im usually pretty good at that! Great acting. I really liked this movie.Im very curious as to where they shot this film. Gorgeous locations in the outdoors. Really creepy and well edited because there are flashbacks and instead of making it confusing it was very suspenseful.
