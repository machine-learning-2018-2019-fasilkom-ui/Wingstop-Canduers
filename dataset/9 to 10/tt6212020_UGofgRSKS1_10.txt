That's the budget on this film. Does it look like? Sure, and that's a good thing. Added to the disturbing ickiness of the mind that must have created it. Full disclosure, I'm a sucker for gratuitous horror - stabbing, cutting, slashing bloody mosaics are like a fine wine when I"m looking to escape. What exactly lives in the attic? You'll have to watch this bad boy to find out, but trust me, you won't be disappointed. Not for everyone, but if you're sick and twisted you'll love it! Yaaaaaay slasher movies!!
