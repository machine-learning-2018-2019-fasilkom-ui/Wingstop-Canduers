First thing you notice is Great performances and new attempt in the script for a female lead has worked well.
Kudos to the writer Laura Steinel for directing the movie too.RogerEbert.com called Taylor Schilling should have become a more valued cinematic asset. Couldn't agree more.After years working on Orange, she has build a stage on working with an ensemble without ego, that is very much vibrant with her scenes with Maddie (another brilliant performer).Kudos to the team and taking enough risks to bring this flick to the screen. Hope it pays off.
