This movie is good. The theater was laughing throughout and everyone I was with had a good time. Kate is a relatable character. She's not perfect but no one is, so those people pretending that they are should stop. The movie was well cast and overall the production value is very good. Shout out to Baby Joker, Kate's assistant, and Kate McKinnon, who did a good job poking fun at the "perfect woman" stereotype.
