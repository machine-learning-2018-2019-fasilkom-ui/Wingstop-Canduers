This is one of the most beautiful and inspiring films I've seen in a while. Cuba is shot beautifully, but most importantly, it captures the amazing energy and joy of the cuban youth. As a musician, music is a hard and long slog. Having films like this is a reminder why I'm doing what I do. And a huge inspiration. Thank you Diplo, Walshy &amp; Jillionaire, as well as the team that made the film.
