I think this is a wonderful film on how with just music alone, can unite over a quarter million people to congregate in one place. Nothing but free spirits with peace as the mission. I love it. Good vibe and good music you can't go wrong spending time watching this. It's also great in coordination with the You tube video series "blow your head" by Diplo on music and how it impacts on it's states around it.
