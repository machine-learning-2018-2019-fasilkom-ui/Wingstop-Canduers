I don't know why the few that have rated this have done so with low scores. It's a great doc that uses a landmark Major Lazer concert behind the perimeter fence of communist Cuba as the vehicle in to exploring Cuban youth's wants and dreams.It's much more than it presents as being, it's evocative and stirring in places, it's a window to Cuba at the eye level of its pop-culturally hungry young people and the event it surrounds where 250,000 unexpectedly turn up to the free gig is breath taking.Watch it!
