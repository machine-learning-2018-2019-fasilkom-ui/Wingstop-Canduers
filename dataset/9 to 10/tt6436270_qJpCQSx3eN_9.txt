I usually don't weite reviews but seeing that there was no review on this film is a bit sad. What a breath of fresh air. Really enjoyed every part of it. Very special movie, very different to what we are all used to but at the same time it is not anything marginal or weird. It is proper sweet smart Christmas movie...
