I settled down to watch this Christmas movie, fully prepared for it to be cheesy and a bit lame but it totally wasnt! It was funny, quirky, sweet with a really decent storyline. The characters are brilliant - all very easy to warm to. Cant believe it was filmed over 6 days! Amazing. Loved the ferret references for Murr too!
