Cleveland, 1961: Nazi criminals, mob, detectives, shady characters... And a lot more in this micro-budget independent film from Ohio. It's rare that someone attempts to produce a period piece on minimal indie budgets, but these guys did. And it's good! An engaging story featuring several funky-crazy-strange characters - in pursuit of "stolen paintings worth millions of dollars"... The film has good cinematography (incorporating some archive footage in a very clever way), superb visual effects, an original music track, and solid performance by its key players on the screen. Very good production (set) design, using old props, historical vehicles, and little elements that are not-so-easy to find on this budget. Overall, it's a pleasant indie surprise from Cleveland's underground film scene.
