Fascinating exploration into paranormal activity in Wisconsin's theatres. Really enjoyed this documentary. As someone who is not a huge 'horror' fan but enjoys the concept of real paranormal activity and the idea that people in the afterlife never really leave, I found this film fascinating.
Michael is a great presenter and it would be hard to deny his experiences as anything but real. Recommended!
