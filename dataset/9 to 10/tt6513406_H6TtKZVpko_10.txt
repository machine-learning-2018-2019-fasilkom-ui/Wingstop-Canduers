Hi,
Here I am a 62 year old (please translate " foreign devil" ) remembering my very young time in the 70's of watching Monkey on the public broadcaster in Australia. I didn't really understand it very well but was throughl6 entertained by the pathos of the 30 minute program and associated adventures.
Thank you to the producers actors and directors of this version of the epic Monkey the King.
It was ver6 educational and entertaining.
Thanks
Regards
Rob
