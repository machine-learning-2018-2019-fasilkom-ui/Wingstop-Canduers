Those expecting another cheapo Asian martial arts flick will be pleasantly disappointed. Wu Kong is clever extension of the Monkey God yarn but filmed in a beautiful and fantastical way, coupled with some poignant scenes and social commentary. The acting was well done by the eye candy leads and the action sequences were interesting too. The CGI was also better than usual. All in all, I was very entertained and actually felt for the characters.
