You won't regret it. If you don't know the backstory to Sun WuKong, the monkey king. Then it may be confusing to watch at first. But once you get that knowledge in and understand what's going on, it's amazing. This movie deserves more credit. Also, the characters and the acting is all spot on. Perfect pick for the every role.
