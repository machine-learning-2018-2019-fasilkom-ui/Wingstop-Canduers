I love this movie and I will watch it many times! I wanted to submit as a review just what is said above, but IMDBS says that my review is too short.
So I will say this:
1. I have no idea how such works are rated 5;
2. People should be obligated to post reviews in order to rate movies;
3. If you are a fan of Monkey King as a hero/character go watch this now!!!
4. If you are a fan of Wuxia genre and martial arts in general go watch this now!!!It's a beautiful story, great visuals, multiple well written characters, great acting.I'm so happy I watched this, It was an experience!
