Already a huge fan of The Monkey King as a character, I am currently reading the original 1400-page-novel "Journey to the West". This film (WuKong) cleverly brings together characters and aspects from the original story in a blend of prequel/sequel that perfectly captures the personality of Sun WuKong and his world. It is flashy (but so is Monkey), it is bold and cheeky (as is he), it is epic (you guessed it), and it has lots of heart (what more can you want?). Overall, extremely entertaining. The creators had a clear vision and executed it well. So many jaw-dropping shots. Great soundtrack. Eddie Peng is perfect in the lead, and is supported by an excellent cast, well-suited to their roles. Absolutely my favorite Monkey King so far (besides the book).
