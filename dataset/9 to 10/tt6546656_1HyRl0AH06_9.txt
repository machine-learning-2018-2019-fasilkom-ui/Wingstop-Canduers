This very interesting documentary looks at six contemporary Russian authors working in different genres and a wide range of themes. It's engaging and gives a real sense of Russia today. I would definitely recommend it as a way to get a deeper sense of what is going on in Russia beyond the headlines.I found the animations too precious, though. There is no need for every animation, even those in a summer birch grove, to have snow in the background. Also, I noticed that some parts of the spoken Russian were not translated. Not enough to change the meaning anywhere, but some of the flavor of the original is lost. Still, this is a good introduction and shows that the tradition of great Russian literature still continues.
