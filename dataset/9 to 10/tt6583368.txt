Excellently produced and narrated! A compelling watch delivering a stark warning that time has almost run out for more and more of the most magnificent animals that share our planet with us. Whilst we, endlessly greedy humans either actively contribute to this irreversible disaster or are too shortsighted and self obsessed to realise what an incredible, irreversible, tragic loss this would be to our planet and to ourselves. An absolute must watch!
