This is one movie I am so thankful I didn't read reviews about. Had I read the reviews I might have missed a fantastic movie. Of course everyone's entitled to their own opinion, but I believe those who give this movie negative reviews don't grasp what they are actually watching. In my opinion, Mr. Eastwood has orchestrated a masterpiece here. Some will think the movie starts slow; I thought the same thing until reflecting on the whole at the end. If you go, don't prejudge half way through before giving the entire movie a chance to tell it's story. I left the film reminded there is still good to be found in this evil world. I left the film reminded of why I chose to serve in the military in the first place. I left the film proud of the people who played a role in this story. Go see it ... look for the humanity in it ... and understand the movie couldn't achieve what it does with a quick start and all action. Two thumbs way up for Mr. Eastwood and the cast!
