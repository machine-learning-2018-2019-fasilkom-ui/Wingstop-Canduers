All the reviews by the professionals said this was just an ok film. Yet, having read the story of Eastwood deciding to star the actual "stars/heroes" I thought it might be worth seeing. Also, the three soldiers who were on the train meant to be having a trip through Europe for pleasure and their "being in the right place at the right time" was amazing. They actually were so genuine and the film managed to convey the decency as well as their bravery in an incredible moment. 
Why this got poor reviews I do not know. Maybe such heroism is not "cool". But as a normally liberal older person, I so agree with Francois Mitterant that we should attempt to "do something" and not cower if possible. The three brave men were wonderful to watch in the film as well - not bad "actors" at all!
