I saw this film at The 2017 Atlanta Film Festival and I was immediately blown away! Story is king in this masterfully crafted work. The characters are impactful and memorable. Daniel Fernández Abelló's breath-taking cinematography reminds me of Colli's work in The Good the Bad and the Ugly: full of richness and depth. The performances are SUPERB! Salier does an excellent job in directing rich performances from his diverse cast! Clifton Collins jr. is the heavyweight (and does his usual EXCELLENT work) but Salier's lesser known supporting cast keeps up with Collins step for step! This film is a MUST SEE!
