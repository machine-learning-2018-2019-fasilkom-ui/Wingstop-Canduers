"The Last Run of Pretty Boy Floyd" is a locally produced docudrama that settles a number of questions related to the myths surrounding Floyd, and most importantly the actual circumstances of the demise of the Oklahoma outlaw. On a limited budget and with the voluntary assistance of interested 'locals' the director, David Dunlap, has done the great service of rendering the most accurate and true account of the death of America's Most Wanted criminal."Come gather round me people, a story I will tell, 'bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw, Oklahoma knew him well....." Woody Guthrie, "The Ballad of Pretty Boy Floyd"
