Okay, this film really makes me think about how I've felt about past films because the bar has been set so much higher with ELEPHANTS. I hope this gem of a film gets the attention it deserves because this is truly wonderful romantic dramedy. It's not just about two real life characters finding each other, or reconnecting, it's that it delves deeper into the complexities of relationships than one normally sees in studio or other indie films. The cinematography is excellent, the score is spot-on and I felt the performances to be absolutely captivating. I really can't say enough good things about this film, other than it's so worthy of your time. HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend. Congrats to the team behind it!!
