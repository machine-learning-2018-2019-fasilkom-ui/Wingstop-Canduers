This concert film captures Roy Orbison's distinctive sound -a rockabilly crooning across 2 octaves which is so simple, so evocative and so sweet- powering stories and poetry of love and loss. A great voice which powered 3 decades of pop music hits. Filmed in the last year of Roy Orbison's life, it shows Roy still in great voice, backed by a killer backup band and vocals- Bruce Springsteen, Bonnie Raitt, Elvis Costello, KD Lang, T. Bone Pickens, several others, all in their prime, respectful of this rockabilly master, all having a blast. Magic stuff!
