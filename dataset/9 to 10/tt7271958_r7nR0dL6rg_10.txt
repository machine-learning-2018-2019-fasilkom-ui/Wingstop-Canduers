Three Days on the Cross was a beautiful film with a deeply thought provoking story. The West Texas wasteland setting of the film truly transforms the viewer to the desert and for much of the film you feel as if you're walking along with Asher (Nathan Martinez), the protagonist. Meanwhile, two "spies" back in the office monitoring Asher offer their philosophy in a thought-provoking dialogue throughout the movie. Wonderful acting all around. Some of the slow motion shots will leave you stunned, as will many of the feats of nature accomplished by Martinez in his nomadic search across the desert. As the cherry on top, even the opening credits were mesmerizingly trippy to the point where I watched them multiple times. This indie-style film rightfully takes its place in the long history of not only American cinema but also Christian theology.
