A good movie. Some clever parts and an unusual set of characters make for a good watch. I recommend this movie. Some cliche parts but it's based on a true story so fair enough. Quite a feel good movie with some roller coaster emotional parts. Best movie I've seen in a while. Having said that it's not exactly phenomenal or to be held up against the greats but forgetting comparison with other better movies it does well as a standalone movie.
