This is the best movie I have ever seen in China about social conflicts in modern time. I am so glad to see the the young director who is as old as me, daring to challenge the authority's strict review process to reveal something truly matters for people. For a young director who just starts his career, if the movie is banned to go to the theatre, it means the end of his career and he will lose all the trust from the investors. And probably never has the chance to make movies again. However, he chooses to insist on something he believes that truly matters.
