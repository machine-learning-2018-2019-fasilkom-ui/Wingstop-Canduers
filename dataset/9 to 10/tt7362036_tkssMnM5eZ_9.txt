Not a beautiful story, but it is one of my favourite Chinese movies so far, From what I know, this one is based on a real story with some rearrangement. Xu Zheng and Ning Hao are very creative filmers. Constrained by the influence Chinese government, a lot of themes are not allowed to be filmed in mainland China. However, this one obviously neatly sidestepped the conflicts with government.
