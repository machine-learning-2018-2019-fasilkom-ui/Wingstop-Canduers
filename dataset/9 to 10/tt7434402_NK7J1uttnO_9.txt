This is what happens when you give a wannabe film maker a few thousand dollars and a black bag full of talent. I'm genuinely struggling to find a flaw. This came from a very dark mind, its not a hero beats mystical monster type film, more of " a 7ft unit with a scythe and a mask wreaking havoc", situation. Imagine being stuck in the woods with Jason Vorhees little brother on the loose, that's what this film is, no long intros developing characters or soppy back story to the eventual hero who makes it out alive, just all is right, then someone gets a scythe in the head, what do we do now!!. None of the characters go into basements armed with letter openers, no-one has a squirrel that can summon Lucifer, no, it's just one scene of a madman on the loose. It's a bit lazy, no effort is made to explain what or who the Tattie-bogle is, but do we need to know? , the mooks running around getting slaughtered didn't seem to care and either do I. I loved this, like the title says, new genre, a lesson in terror.
