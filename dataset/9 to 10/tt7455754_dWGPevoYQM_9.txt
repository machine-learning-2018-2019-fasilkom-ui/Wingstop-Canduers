This is a very well researched movie about plant-based athletes. It completely changes the perception that vegan/plant based eating is not for athletes/body builders. Has very insightful interviews with real life olympian vegan athletes and body builders about how their life turned around after they turned plant based. This is a great film that I would recommend anyone interested in improving their health and life style to watch.
