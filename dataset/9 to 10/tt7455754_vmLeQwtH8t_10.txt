Saw a preview version (the movie is still undergoing modifications) at a private showing in late February. This will shock men whose standard mantra is "real men must eat meat" and those family meal planners who think that eating meat is essential for proving protein to their families, especially youngsters (both girls and boys) who have desires for improving their physical performance.. The reality is the reverse.
It is dramatic, powerful and amazing and should not be missed.
