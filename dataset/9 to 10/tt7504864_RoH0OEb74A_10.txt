Maybe the previous reviewer had this movie confused with another film, as there was nothing short about this movie at it's lengthy 2.5 hour runtime. The movie captured the tone of the comic with the intensity of an extended episode of Breaking Bad (which is precisely what each character did). At no point was this a comedy, but a commentary on human sin and darkness. I liked how each character had their turn with satan's mask in each act of the movie. Not your feel good movie, but a great indie take on The Mask.
