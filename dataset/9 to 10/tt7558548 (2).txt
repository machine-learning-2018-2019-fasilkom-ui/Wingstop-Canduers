I love watching indie films over the big budget blockbuster movies as you can often find the hidden gems that are so creative and raw. This film deals with real life issues and in that respect makes the film very relatable. The flashback sequences help to piece together the history of what each character is struggling with. We see how they cope in their own way and ultimately take steps to move forward. Interspersed with humor to lighten the mood, overall I found it very heartwarming. I thought it was very well acted for a small film and loved the original songs by Rebecca Strong.
