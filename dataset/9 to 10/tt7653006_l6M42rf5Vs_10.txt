Ignore comments about this documentary being liberal bias and about "thugs" -- this film is a historical and situational look into the lives of the Baltimore community, both citizens, police officers, and everyone in between. This documentary seamlessly ties together everyone's competing realities over Baltimore and the 2015 riots and asks bigger questions about the effectiveness and accountability that exists (or lack thereof) within legal and judicial systems in the United States, particularly Baltimore.
