This documentary is based on the events that happened in Baltimore following the death of Freddie Gray. Please skip this movie if you are someone who just wants to give it a bad rating without watching it or use it to inflame biases further. I liked it because it provided insight on what factored in to the responses of many residents after the death of Freddie Gray. It's easy for people to overlook the catalyst that Freddie Gray's death was to recipe for disaster that had been mixing for some time. This documentary isn't a "woah is me" tale; it also doesn't try to "explain away" anything bad by some protestors. It does, however, provide some valuable insight to the mindset of those who observed, participated in, or were motivated to activism by Baltimore. The uprising in Baltimore was something that America had been on the precipice of for a while. Even if you watch this documentary with preconceived notions about minority "rioting", Freddie Gray's death or why the youth of Baltimore eventually responded the way that they did, consider keeping an open mind.There's nothing wrong with seeing things from a different point of view or gaining a more well rounded understanding of an incident. I think this documentary helps with that.
