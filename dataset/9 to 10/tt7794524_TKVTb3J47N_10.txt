The film carries a good social message that internal enemies are harmful than external enemies. Allu Arjun's dedication is visible on the screen. His short tempered attitude is really applauded. Every action sequence in the film is very intense in such a way that Allu Arjun fan could enjoy a lot. Arjun Sarja and Nadia Moidu had done theirs best. Surely this movie all types of audiences especially Allu Arjun's fans. Second half is lengthy but very high on emotional content. At last the film is about patriotism and ends with a patriotic note. Sai Kumar is the foundation for second half. The fim is a sincere patriotic drama with all commercial ingredients like Action,Romance,Family Sentiments,Comedy. Some scenes in second half describing about a man's character inspires everyone.
 This is a must watch fim but don't try to raise any logic. Just watch it as a patriotic drama.
