For a low-budget feature this film is well executed and has a studio "A" feel throughout. JCVD is award worthy and the entire cast is excellent. As an Editor I appreciate the monumental task of piecing together something coherent and watchable but this goes beyond that into the highest level of the craft. It's heartbreaking to think of people living in such desperate conditions and the Director conveys the "street" very well. Thumbs Up!
