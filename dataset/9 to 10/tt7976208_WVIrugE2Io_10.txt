This Movie has so much heart in it! I know the subject matter is disturbing but Hillary Duffs performance made me have so mush sympathy for Sharon! I really think a lot of people missed the point especially with the ending. Yes it's sod and brutal but in reality it's a love letter to Sharon and even though their is evil in the world there's still a lot of love. I left the movie sad,scared,and hopeful that people can always choose happiness! A+
